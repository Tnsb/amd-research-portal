# AI usage disclosure 

I used Cursor (Composer / AI assistant) to help scaffold and accelerate development of the ingestion pipeline, RAG retrieval and generation flow, structured citations, the Phase 2 evaluation report, the Phase 3 Personal Research Portal (Streamlit app, threads, artifacts, eval summary), and documentation (README, Makefile, reports). I manually reviewed and edited the code to ensure correctness and alignment with requirements.

I ran make setup, make query, make eval, and make portal, verified citations resolve to data_manifest.csv, and made manual revisions to the reports and deliverables.
