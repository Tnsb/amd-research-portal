# AI usage disclosure 

I used Cursor (Composer / AI assistant) to help scaffold and accelerate development of the ingestion pipeline, RAG retrieval and generation flow, structured citations, and the Phase 2 evaluation report, along with the README, Makefile, data manifest, and corpus documentation. After that, I manually reviewed and edited the code to ensure correctness, alignment with the project requirements, and reproducibility. I made additional code revisions specifically to fix correctness issues and improve reliability where needed.

I added my API key to .env, ran make setup, make query, and make eval, and carefully reviewed the evaluation report and failure-case evidence against the logs. I also verified that citations correctly resolve to data_manifest.csv and the chunk_map, and made manual wording, formatting, and content revisions to the report to fully meet the deliverables.
