Abstract
While large language models (LLMs) have
proven to be effective on a large variety of tasks,
they are also known to hallucinate information.
To measure whether an LLM prefers factually
consistent continuations of its input, we pro-
pose a new benchmark called FIB (Factual
Inconsistency Benchmark) that focuses on the
task of summarization. Specifically, our bench-
mark involves comparing the scores an LLM
assigns to a factually consistent versus a fac-
tually inconsistent summary for an input news
article. For factually consistent summaries, we
use human-written reference summaries that
we manually verify as factually consistent. To
generate summaries that are factually inconsis-
tent, we generate summaries from a suite of
summarization models that we have manually
annotated as factually inconsistent. A model's
factual consistency is then measured according
to its accuracy, i.e. the proportion of documents
where it assigns a higher score to the factually
consistent summary. To validate the usefulness
of FIB, we evaluate 23 large language mod-
els ranging from 1B to 176B parameters from
six different model families including BLOOM
and OPT. We find that existing LLMs gener-
ally assign a higher score to factually consis-
tent summaries than to factually inconsistent
summaries. However, if the factually inconsis-
tent summaries occur verbatim in the document,
then LLMs assign a higher score to these factu-
ally inconsistent summaries than factually con-
sistent summaries. We validate design choices
in our benchmark including the scoring method
and source of distractor summaries. 1
1 Introduction
Factual inconsistency is a widespread problem in
natural language generation tasks (Maynez et al.,
2020; Weng et al., 2020; Devaraj et al., 2022). For
text summarization in particular, it has been shown
that models often hallucinate new information or

generate content that contradicts the source doc-
ument (Cao et al., 2018; Maynez et al., 2020).
These works usually study supervised summariza-
tion models that are either trained from scratch or
fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model (Wan
and Bansal, 2022). Recently, however, NLP has
experienced a paradigm shift towards using large
language models (LLMs) rather than supervised
models. LLMs are generally pre-trained on a large
corpus of unstructured text and then applied to a
task through instructive prompts. In light of this
new paradigm, our goal is to evaluate the factual
consistency of large language models using text
summarization as a testbed.
To achieve this goal, we propose FIB (the
Factual Inconsistency Benchmark) to measure how
often models prefer factually consistent summaries
arXiv:2211.08412v2 [cs.CL] 2 Dec 2023
over factually inconsistent summaries. In FIB,
models are given a document and are evaluated
on whether they assign a higher score to a factually
consistent summary than a factually inconsistent
summary. Scores are assigned based on a model's
assigned probability to the summary. We use accu-
racy on this binary classification task as a proxy for
how factually consistent a model is. FIB consists
of over 3,500 pairs of summaries that wereall man-
ually annotated as either factually consistent or fac-
tually inconsistent. The benchmark is based on doc-
uments and summaries from the XSum (Narayan
et al., 2018b) and CNN/DM (Hermann et al., 2015)
datasets to test behavior on abstractive and extrac-
tive summarization, respectively. For factually con-
sistent summaries, we use reference summaries
from the datasets that we verify are factually con-
sistent or manually edit to make them factually con-
sistent. The factually inconsistent summaries were
generated from 22 models trained for summariza-
tion and then annotated as factually inconsistent.
To explore the behavior of existing models on
FIB, we evaluate 23 LLMs from 6 different model
families including BLOOM, OPT, GPT, and T0
(Radford et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022b; Sanh
et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Lester et al., 2021;
Scao et al., 2022) ranging from 1B to 176B param-
eters. Next, we analyze whether the method used
to generate the factually inconsistent summaries af-
fects how often models prefers factually consistent
summaries over factually inconsistent summaries.
To do so, we evaluate these models on factually in-
consistent summaries from three additional sources:
(1) unedited reference summaries that we anno-
tated as factually inconsistent, (2) summaries edited
via FactCC (Kryscinski et al., 2020), and (3) sum-
maries produced by MFMA (Lee et al., 2022). In
addition, we test 4 different scoring functions: con-
ditional log-likelihood (LL), length-normalized LL,
pointwise mutual information (PMI), and length-
normalized PMI. Overall, we find that: (1) The
LLMs we consider typically assign a higher score
to factually consistent summaries than to factually
inconsistent summaries (e.g. 72.4% of the time for
BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022)), but (2) LLMs rarely
prefer factually consistent summaries over factually
inconsistent summaries copied verbatim from the
document (e.g. 9.6% of the time for BLOOM), (3)
LLMs generally become more factually consistent
as they are scaled up, and (4) FactCC-generated fac-
tually inconsistent summaries can fool some LLMs
at a similar rate to model-generated factually incon-
sistent summaries.
In summary, our contributions are: (1) a bench-
marking procedure and collection of annotated
summaries for probing the factual consistency of
LLMs and (2) a thorough evaluation of 23 LLMs
from 6 different model families of up to 176B pa-
rameters. We hope FIB and our results help shed
light on the factuality of LLMs.

2.1 Factuality Evaluation Datasets
In the literature on text summarization, many
datasets with human-labeled factually consistent
and inconsistent summaries have been introduced
for meta-evaluation purposes (i.e., evaluating fac-
tuality evaluation metrics) or for training the met-
rics themselves. Pagnoni et al. (2021) introduced
the FRANK benchmark that contains 2250 model-
generated summaries with factuality labels for each
summary sentence. Similarly, Gabriel et al. (2021)
proposed the GO FIGURE meta-evaluation frame-
work that has 1500 model-generated summaries
that include factuality labels. Besides these two
benchmarks, many other works collected their own
small-scale factuality evaluation datasets for evalu-
ating their proposed metrics or analyzing the factu-
ality of summarization models (Falke et al., 2019;
Maynez et al., 2020; Kryscinski et al., 2020; Wang
et al., 2020a; Durmus et al., 2020; Lux et al., 2020).
Ribeiro et al. (2022) combined labeled datasets
from four works and formed the FactCollect dataset
with more than 9000 summary sentences and their
factuality labels. Additionally, a few other works
proposed to automatically obtain factually incon-
sistent summaries by perturbing the reference sum-
maries (Kryscinski et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2022),
e.g., entity swapping. However, Goyal and Dur-
rett (2021) showed that these automatic techniques
target inherently different error distributions than
those seen in actual model generations. Goyal and
Durrett (2020) considered model outputs at the
top of beam search as factual and bottom genera-
tions as non-factual. The aforementioned works
mainly focus on abstractive summarization; in con-
trast, Zhang et al. (2022a) introduced a factual-
ity evaluation dataset for extractive summarization
which we use as part of FIB. Previous datasets
do not annotate reference summaries and instead
only annotate model generations as factually con-
sistent or factually inconsistent. However, the ref-
erence summaries are not always factually consis-
tent (Maynez et al., 2020; Bommasani and Cardie,
2020; Tejaswin et al., 2021) which means that
some of the factually inconsistent summaries might
not have any factually consistent summary to pair
with. Hence, we perform a manual verification
of reference summaries as factually consistent for
FIB. Additionally, FIB aims to evaluate the fac-
tual consistency of LLMs themselves instead of
meta-evaluating evaluation metrics.
Besides summarization, Devaraj et al. (2022)
proposed a factuality evaluation dataset for text sim-
plification. In addition, some datasets have been
introduced for checking a fact or claim against a
large knowledge base (Thorne et al., 2018; Augen-
stein et al., 2019); here, we instead focus on factual
consistency of conditional model continuations.
2.2 Factuality Evaluation Metrics
Many metrics have been proposed to evaluate
the factual consistency of model-generated sum-
maries. These metrics can be roughly catego-
rized into entailment-based metrics and question-
generation/answering (QA/QG)-based metrics.
Entailment-based metrics check whether each sum-
mary sentence (or a more fine-grained subsentence)
is entailed by the source document (Falke et al.,
2019; Kryscinski et al., 2020; Goyal and Durrett,
2020; Maynez et al., 2020). QA/QG-based met-
rics are designed based on the idea that a question
should have the same answer whether it is based on
the summary or the document (Wang et al., 2020a;
Durmus et al., 2020; Scialom et al., 2021). Relat-
edly, Goodrich et al. (2019) evaluated facutality
by checking factual tuples extracted by OpenIE
and Ribeiro et al. (2022) used the AMR graphs of
the summary and the document for assessing fac-
tual consistency. All these metrics were designed
to evaluate models trained specifically for summa-
rization. In this work, we focus more broadly on
evaluating the factual consistency of LLMs.
3 FIB: Factual Inconsistency Benchmark
Each example in FIB consists of a document and
two summaries: a factually consistent summary
and a factually inconsistent summary. Models are
evaluated based on the proportion of times they
assign a higher score to a factually consistent sum-
mary than to a factually inconsistent summary. We
define a factually consistent summary as a sum-
mary whose contents can be inferred solely from
the document. This means that even if a summary
contains true information, if the information is not
found in the document, then the summary is factu-
ally inconsistent. For example, the Gold summary
in fig. 1 is factually consistent as it is written, but if
we swapped Peveril Pointwith a cliff, then it would
no longer be factually consistent, even if Peveril
Point is technically a cliff, since this fact cannot be
inferred from the document.
We compare the factual consistency of mod-
els on both extractive and abstractive summaries.
Extractive summaries occur verbatim in the doc-
ument while abstractive summaries do not. We
use two summarization datasets as our testbed:
CNN/DM (See et al., 2017; Hermann et al., 2015)
for extractive summaries and XSum (Narayan
et al., 2018a) for abstractive summaries. CNN/DM
consists of English documents about the news
from CNN/Daily Mail and summaries that are
several sentences long with 287K/13K/11K ex-
amples for train/val/test.2 XSum consists of En-
glish documents about the news from BBC and
short summaries with 204K/11K/11K examples for
train/val/test.3 The CNN/DM dataset is distributed
under an Apache 2.0 license and XSum is under
a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
license. Our use is consistent with the intended
use and we release our code under an Apache 2.0
license and the data for FIB under a Creative Com-
mons Attribution 4.0 International license.
3.1 Dataset Construction
We describe how we construct the factually consis-
tent and factually inconsistent summaries for FIB.
When performing annotations, each summary was
annotated by two annotators. Four of the authors
performed the annotations. Our inter-annotator
agreement was 91.3%. Whenever there was a dis-
agreement on a given summary, the two annotators
would discuss and resolve the disagreement. See
appendix A for annotator instructions.
Factually Consistent Summaries. Though the
summarization datasets we consider include ref-
erence summaries, the reference summaries are
not necessarily factually consistent with the doc-
ument (Maynez et al., 2020). To account for this,
we annotate reference summaries for 500 and 100
documents from XSum and CNN/DM respectively
2https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_
dailymail
3https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum
as either factually consistent or factually incon-
sistent. Then, we edit the factually inconsistent
reference summaries to be factually consistent us-
ing minimal edits. Factually inconsistent reference
summaries usually contain information that is true
but not found in the document. Thus, most edits
involve removing or changing certain keywords or
phrases not present in the document. Two anno-
tators then verified the edited summary was factu-
ally consistent. The percentage of factually consis-
tent summaries that were edited from the original
reference summary was roughly 90% for XSum
and 30% for CNN/DM. We denote these annotated
factually consistent reference summaries as Gold
summaries. See appendix B for some examples of
edited summaries.
Factually Inconsistent Summaries. To obtain
factually inconsistent summaries, we generate sum-
maries from models trained on a given summariza-
tion dataset and annotate the generated summaries
as factually consistent or factually inconsistent. We
then retain the model-generated summaries that
were annotated as factually inconsistent. We use
15 extractive models to generate summaries for
CNN/DM and 7 generative models to generate sum-
maries for XSum. See appendix D for the list of
models used to generate the summaries. For XSum,
we annotate the model-generated summaries our-
selves and for CNN/DM we source the factual-
consistency annotations from Zhang et al. (2022a).
See appendix C for some examples of factually
inconsistent model-extracted summaries.
For the dataset underlying our benchmark, we
create a paired example for every possible factu-
ally inconsistent summary with the Gold summary
for a given document. In the end, we have 3,124
factually consistent/inconsistent summary pairs
across 500 unique documents for XSum and 457
pairs across 96 unique documents for CNN/DM (4
CNN/DM documents were dropped since all the
models generated factually consistent summaries
for them). A model's accuracy on FIB is then sim-
ply the proportion of summary pairs where the
model assigns a higher score to the Gold summary
than to the factually inconsistent summary.
3.2 Scoring Function
For FIB, we are primarily interested in a scoring
function to measure the consistency of the sum-
mary and the document. A natural scoring func-
tion is the model's assigned log-likelihood (LL)
of the summary given the document, but LL has
two major issues. First, the log-likelihood has a
bias towards shorter summaries since the proba-
bility of each token in a summary is multiplied
together to obtain the log-likelihood of the entire
summary, and thus shorter summaries tend to pro-
duce higher log-likehoods. Second, if the summary
alone has a high likelihood, then the model might
assign a high likelihood to the summary, even if
the summary and the document are not that re-
lated. To address the first issue, we normalize by
the length of the summary. To address the second
issue, we use the pointwise mutual information
(PMI), which accounts for the likelihood of the
summary by subtracting the log-likelihood of the
summary alone from the log-likelihood of the sum-
mary conditioned on the document. Several recent
works have used the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) as a way of scoring a language model's gen-
erations: Holtzman et al. (2021) used PMI to solve
multiple-choice tasks that probe for knowledge us-
ing GPT3 and Padmakumar and He (2021) used
PMI for unsupervised extractive summarization.
Concurrently, van der Poel et al. (2022) show that
optimizing for PMI during decoding can decrease
hallucinations in language models.
To address both these issues, we use the length-
normalized PMI as our default scoring function,
where the length normalization is performed by
averaging over tokens. Specifically, given docu-
ment d and summary s which consists of T tokens
{s1, s2, ..., sT }, the length-normalized PMI is de-
fined as
T log
T
∑
t=1
P(st∣d, s1, ..., st−1) (1)
− 1
T log
T
∑
t=1
P(st∣, s1, ..., st−1)
We ablate the impact of using different scoring
functions in section 4.4.

Having defined our benchmark, we now evaluate
the factual consistency of various LLMs and com-
pare with several other methods for generating al-
ternative summaries and assigning scores to LM
generations.

(GPT, OPT, BLOOM, T5-LM-Adapt) and mod-
els that were trained on XSum and CNN/DM in
a multi-task fashion (T0, FLAN-T5). For each
model, we use the same 3 prompts and report
the median performance across prompts, follow-
ing Sanh et al. (2022). See appendix E for the
prompt templates used. We use a maximum se-
quence length of 512, which was also applied when
sampling 500 documents from XSUM for annotat-
ing factual consistency. We use Pytorch (Paszke
et al., 2019) and HuggingFace (Wolf et al., 2020)
to run the models, and use bitsandbytes (Dettmers
et al., 2022) to do 8-bit inference for the larger mod-
els. All experiments were run on NVIDIA A6000s
or 80GB NVIDIA A100s (depending on the model)
and took about two days.
4.2 Main Results
We show the performance of all the models on
XSum and CNN/DM in fig. 2. On XSum, we high-
light the following:
• Factual Consistency: Models generally pre-
fer Gold summaries over factually inconsistent
model-generated summaries, but the average ac-
curacy of any model is still far from 100%.
• Effect of Scale: Performance generally increases
slightly with scale within a given model family
with the exception of T0, where the 11-billion-
parameter model underperforms T0-3B. For zero-
shot LLMs, the performance is remarkably simi-
lar across model families.
• Effect of Training: Both FLAN-T5 and T0 un-
derperform the zero-shot models, which could be
because they were trained on the XSum dataset,
which had many reference summaries that were
factually inconsistent.
In contrast to our results on XSum, we find
that models rarely assign a higher score to factu-
ally consistent reference summaries than to factu-
ally inconsistent model-extracted summaries on the
CNN/DM dataset. However, if the factually consis-
tent summary is also model-extracted, then models
also assign higher scores to the factually consistent
model-extracted summary. This suggests that all
models have a strong preference for text copied
from the input regardless of its factual-consistency.
4.3 Generating Alternative Summaries
We also analyze the impact of the the method used
to generate factually inconsistent summaries. To
do so, we compare the model's performance when
using different methods for generating the factu-
ally inconsistent summary. We note that Goyal and
Durrett (2021) showed that these automatic tech-
niques target inherently different error distributions
than those seen in actual model generations. We
experiment with the following alternative methods
for obtaining factually inconsistent summaries:
• MFMA, proposed by Lee et al. (2022), uses pre-
trained masked language models to generate fac-
tually inconsistent summaries. Specifically, sum-
maries are generated by reconstructing the refer-
ence summary conditioned on the document and
reference summary with α and β percent of the
entities masked out respectively. The MFMA pro-
cedure first fine-tunes a pre-trained masked LM
to reconstruct summaries in this setup and then
uses the fine-tuned model to generate new sum-
maries. For example, in fig. 1, if we masked out

Figure 3: Preference for the Gold summary exhibited by BLOOM and T0 when using different methods for
generating alternative choices.
Peveril Pointin the reference summary and the
model generated the grand canyon instead, then
the factually-inconsistent MFMA-generated sum-
mary would be A middle-aged woman has been
driven by ambulance to a park after falling from
the grand canyon. We follow the setup in MFMA
and use T5-base (Raffel et al., 2020) and BART-
base (Lewis et al., 2020a) to generate the sum-
maries with α = 0.8 and β = 0.6. Since there is
no guarantee that the model-reconstructed sum-
maries are factually inconsistent, we annotate
their factual-consistency and only keep the ones
that are factually inconsistent. We construct fac-
tually inconsistent summaries from MFMA by
combining all factually inconsistent summaries
generated by T5-base and BART-base.
• FactCC, proposed by Kryscinski et al. (2020),
generates factually inconsistent summaries via
heuristic perturbations to reference summaries.
FactCC uses two ways to perturb the reference
summary: entity swapping and sentence nega-
tion. Entity swapping replaces an entity (i.e.
pronouns, dates, numbers and named entities)
in the reference summary with a different en-
tity from the document and sentence negation
refers to negating a verb. For example, in fig. 1,
if we negated has to hasn't, then the factually-
inconsistent FactCC-generated summary would
be A middle-aged woman hasn't been airlifted to
a park after falling from Peveril Point.
• FIR (factually inconsistent reference) summaries.
Since some of the original reference summaries
were factually inconsistent and had to be edited
to become factually consistent, we use these orig-
inal reference summaries as an alternative source
of factually inconsistent summaries.
As an additional baseline, we consider using
factually consistent model-generated summaries
rather than a factually inconsistent summary as the
alternative summary. This allows us to test whether
models prefer model-generated summaries over
Gold summaries. We call this setup of where the
alternative choice is a factually consistent model-
generated summaries FCMG (Factually-Consistent
Model-Generated summaries).
A comparison of different methods for generat-
ing alternative summaries is shown in fig. 3. We
only plot results for BLOOM and T0 since the re-
sults for other decoder-only zero-shot LLMs are
similar to those for BLOOM and the results for
FLAN-T5 are similar to T0. We highlight the fol-
lowing trends:
• Preference for factually consistent model-
generated summaries depends on whether sum-
maries are extractive: On XSum, models are
almost at chance when distinguishing between
factually consistent model-generated summaries
and Gold summaries. This is evident from the
accuracy on FCMG being around 50%. How-
ever, on CNN/DM, models consistently prefer
factually consistent model-extracted summaries
to Gold summaries. We conclude that models
prefer model-extracted summaries that occur ver-
batim in the document, regardless of their factual
consistency.

Figure 4: Performance of various models on FIB when using different scoring functions.
• MFMA's Ineffectiveness: On both XSum
and CNN/DM, models rarely assign MFMA-
generated summaries a higher score than Gold
summaries - the accuracy on MFMA is between
85% to 100% across all models.
• FactCC's Effectiveness for zero-shot LLMs:On
XSum, BLOOM's performance is similar when
either FactCC or model-generated factually in-
consistent summaries are used as an alternative,
and on CNN/DM, performance is similar for
FactCC and factually inconsistent reference sum-
maries. This suggests that FactCC generates
somewhat plausible factually inconsistent sum-
maries for zero-shot decoder-only LLMs.
• FactCC's Effectiveness for other models: How-
ever, T0, FLAN-T5, and T5-LM-Adapt (see ap-
pendix H for FLAN-T5 and T5-LM-Adapt ac-
curacies) all perform better when using FactCC-
generated factually inconsistent summaries than
when using model-generated factually inconsis-
tent summaries. This indicates FactCC might
not be effective in generating plausible factually
inconsistent summaries across all model architec-
tures and training schemes.
• Preference for Edited Summaries: On XSum and
CNN/DM, models tend to prefer factually consis-
tent reference summaries over factually inconsis-
tent reference summaries. This is evident from
the accuracy on FIR being around 80% and indi-
cates that models tend to prefer factually consis-
tent summaries over factually inconsistent sum-
maries.
4.4 Scoring Function
In FIB, we use the length-normalized PMI as the
scoring function. To validate this choice, we com-
pare various alternative scoring functions: standard
log-likelihood, length-normalized log-likelihood,
and the non-length-normalized PMI. We show re-
sults for BLOOM, OPT-175B and T0 on XSum and
CNN/DM using different scoring methods in fig. 4.
In general we see that the average PMI enables
models to best distinguish between factually con-
sistent and factually inconsistent summaries. We
also compare each scoring function on the alter-
nate sources of factually inconsistent summaries;
see appendix F for detailed results. We find that
log-likelihood works best when the factually in-
consistent summary was produced by FactCC or
is a model generation on CNN/DM. We hypothe-
size that log-likelihood works better than length-
normalized PMI on FactCC because the generated
summaries are often non-fluent and therefore are
assigned a low likelihood regardless of their fac-
tual consistency. For model-extracted summaries
on CNN/DM, we hypothesize that log-likelihood
works better than length-normalized PMI because
log-likelihood is not as biased towards summaries
extracted from the document as PMI is.
5 Analysis
To get a better sense of what kind of factually
inconsistent model-generated summaries tend to
fool models into assigning a higher score than
the Gold summary, we show some examples for
BLOOM in table 1. These factually inconsistent
summaries consist of extrinsic hallucinations that

add new information rather than intrinsic halluci-
nations that manipulate the information in the doc-
ument (Maynez et al., 2020). In addition, these fac-
tually inconsistent summaries contain information
that is actually false, not just information absent
from the document.
5.1 Factual Consistency of Models Used to
Generate Summaries
We take the models used to generate the factu-
ally inconsistent summaries for XSum and evaluate
them against each other using the same procedure
as in FIB. Specifically, we use factually inconsis-
tent summaries produced by a "generating model"
and measure how often an "evaluated model" as-
signs a higher score to the Gold summary than it
does to the factually inconsistent model-generated
summaries. The result is summarized in fig. 5, with
full results in appendix K. The accuracies down
the diagonal are the lowest, which means models
perform poorly when scoring their own factually
inconsistent summary. This is expected since mod-
els should give high scores to factually inconsistent
summaries they generate. In most cases, Gold sum-
maries are preferred less than 50% of the time,
suggesting that summarization models tend to as-
sign higher scores to model-generated factually
inconsistent summaries. However, certain mod-
els (BLOOM and T5-large) almost always produce
summaries that are assigned low scores by the other
models. We leave exploration of this trend to future
work.
6 Conclusion and Takeaways
We present FIB, a new benchmark for evaluating
the factual consistency of language models, and
evaluate 23 large language models on FIB. Our
takeaways are: (1) LLMs tend to assign higher
scores to factually consistent summaries than to fac-
tually inconsistent summaries, except that LLMs
almost always assign higher scores to extracted
summaries even if they are factually inconsistent
and (2) length-normalized PMI enables models to
most effectively detect factually inconsistent sum-
maries. Our results open new avenues for future
work, including a more fine-grained study on the
type of factually inconsistent errors different LLMs
make and investigating the effect training on sum-
marization has on the factual consistency of LLMs.
7 Limitations
One limitation with FIB is that it only measures
the factual consistency of language models for the
task of summarization, and specifically news sum-
marization. It is not clear how well the results will
generalize, for example, to other domains such as
scientific article or other tasks such as question
answering.

A Annotation Instructions
The annotators were instructed to mark a summary
as factually inconsistent if any information in the
summary was not implied in the document. We
assume no access to external knowledge so the
summary has to be implied solely from the docu-
ment. External knowledge is broadly defined as
any knowledge that cannot be inferred from com-
mon sense alone. For example, the capital of a
country or the rules of a sport would be external
knowledge.
B Sample Edited Summaries
We show some examples of documents with the
original factually inconsistent reference summary
and the edited factually consistent summary on
XSum in table 2.
C Sample Model-Extracted factually
inconsistent
We show some examples of documents with
model-extracted factually inconsistent summaries
on CNN/DM in table 3.
D Models Used to Generate Summaries
We use the following models to generate sum-
maries for XSum and include the respective Hug-
gingFace model name:
• BLOOM-560m (Scao et al., 2022) -

around his neck ... " i forced it ( the cord ) down and then other
people came to help , and then i got out and he started saying
that we were here to kill him , " minatel said . the man was not
restrained for the rest of the trip , but the flight crew told him to

Table 3: Two examples of model-extracted factually inconsistent summaries. The annotations were sourced
from Zhang et al. (2022a). These examples have id 41c6edecee127c396d17e2e9115a4a89252cc52b and id
32655a04c9e4733a1ae4b210a045bc6e0d443d85 respectively. The first example uses Textrank (Mihalcea and
Tarau, 2004) to extract the summary. It is factually incorrect since 'we' refers to pg & e and not the commission.
The second example uses MatchSumm (Zhong et al., 2020) to extract the summary. It is factually inconsistent since
the man refers to the stranger and not Oliver Minatel.
