Abstract Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Gen-
eration (RAG) have revolutionized natural language process-
ing by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with ex-
ternal information retrieval, enabling accurate, up-to-date, and
verifiable text generation across diverse applications. How-
ever, evaluating RAG systems presents unique challenges due
to their hybrid architecture that combines retrieval and gen-
eration components, as well as their dependence on dynamic
knowledge sources in the LLM era. In response, this paper
provides a comprehensive survey of RAG evaluation meth-
ods and frameworks, systematically reviewing traditional and
emerging evaluation approaches, for system performance, fac-
tual accuracy, safety, and computational efficiency in the LLM
era. We also compile and categorize the RAG-specific datasets
and evaluation frameworks, conducting a meta-analysis of
evaluation practices in high-impact RAG research. To the
best of our knowledge, this work represents the most com-
prehensive survey for RAG evaluation, bridging traditional
and LLM-driven methods, and serves as a critical resource
for advancing RAG development.

This approach significantly improves Large Language Mod-
els through non-parametric learning, multi-source knowledge
integration, and specialized domain adaptation [1, 2]. By
connecting LLMs with external databases, RAG produces re-
sponses that are both contextually appropriate and grounded
in authoritative, up-to-date information, marking a substan-
tial advancement in developing more sophisticated natural
language processing (NLP) systems [3, 4].
As a sophisticated and expansive system that encompasses
numerous elements from both the LLM and retrieval domains,
RAG can be approximately segmented into two principal sec-
tions from a macroscopic viewpoint: retrieval and genera-
tion. The retrieval section typically entails diverse operations
including preprocessing, dense or sparse retrieval, rerank-
ing and pruning, etc [5, 6]. The generation section com-
prises components such as retrieval planning, the integration
of multi-source knowledge, and logical reasoning [7, 8]. Ad-
ditionally, RAG systems incorporate interconnected upstream
and downstream elements such as document chunking, em-
bedding generation, and mechanisms for ensuring security
and credibility [9]. The overall performance of RAG systems
depends not only on each individual component but also on
their interactions and integrated functionality.
When faced with such complex systems, a fundamental
and practical question arises regarding the evaluation frame-
work for assessing the efficacy of architectural methodologies
governing both the holistic system and its constituent compo-
nents. This challenge proves particularly pronounced in RAG
systems, where three factors - the expansive scope of im-
plementation domains, the heterogeneity of internal compo-
nents, and the dynamic progression of current developments
- collectively render the establishment of a unified system-

atic evaluation paradigm an ongoing research frontier. In re-
sponse to this, we conducted this survey on RAG Evaluation
to gather methods for multi-scale assessment of RAG in re-
cent years. The comprehensiveness of this survey is demon-
strated in four aspects: 1) Systematic completeness, encom-
passing both the evaluation of RAG's internal components
and the system as a whole; 2) Methodological variety, in-
cluding both traditional statistically-based evaluation metrics
and the innovative methods characteristic of the LLM era;
3) Source diversity, incorporating both structured evaluation
frameworks, as well as cutting-edge methods scattered across
various papers; and 4) Practicality, both in terms of metrics'
definition to be evaluated and their subsequent application.
Through this multi-dimensional approach, we aim to provide
researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive toolkit for
evaluating and improving RAG systems.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 offers a concise review of the existing LLM-based RAG
system to provide the reader with relevant background knowl-
edge. Our comprehensive evaluation is divided into two dis-
tinct sections: Internal Evaluation(Section 3) and External
Evaluation (Section 4). Internal Evaluation assesses com-
ponent level performance and methodology-specific metrics
within basic RAG systems, focusing on technical advance-
ment. External evaluation examines system-wide factors like
safety and e fficiency, emphasizing practical viability. We
pay particular attention to the emerging trend of LLM-based
evaluation methods, which represent a novel assessment ap-
proach unique to the current era. Section 5 presents exist-
ing RAG evaluation frameworks, datasets, and methods, pro-
viding a practical resource for researchers. Furthermore, we
compiled a comprehensive collection of high-level RAG stud-
ies spanning multiple dimensions in recent years, and con-
ducted a preliminary analysis and discussion from the per-
spective of evaluation (Section 6).
2 Background
2.1 Large Language Model (LLM)
Large Language Models, with billions of parameters, are a
class of generative neural language models trained on exten-
sive natural language data [10, 11]. Due to the wide cover-
age of the training corpus, LLMs are considered to implicitly
integrate world knowledge [12]. LLMs are capable of ad-
hering to human instructions or requests though instruction
tuning, thus being able to e ffectively understand and gener-
ate human-like text [13]. Its generalization open up a wide
range of applications, such as NLP, signal processing, and
recommender systems [14, 15]. However, LLM's capabil-
ity remains circumscribed by their training data. It is some-
times predisposed to generating factually inconsistent out-
puts (hallucinations), particularly when processing novel in-
formation beyond training data [16]. Despite the adaptability
of LLMs to diverse downstream tasks through post-training
or fine-tuning on specific datasets, these methods encounter
challenges related to arithmetic, timeliness, flexibility, or us-
ability (on close models). Optimization techniques during
the LLM inference phase have thus garnered significant at-
tention. One of the representative techniques is Prompt En-
gineering, in which artificially constructed task descriptions
and commands are used to enhance LLMs' understanding
of task objectives. In-context learning is designed to enable
LLMs to analyze patterns and generalize from task samples,
offering substantial advantages in few-shot scenarios [17,18].
Unlike these approaches, RAG aims to address the issue of
knowledge limitations inherent in LLM by incorporating ex-
ternal knowledge. Both LLM and RAG possess complemen-
tary strengths: RAG can effectively leverage the superior rea-
soning capabilities of LLMs, combined with the broad knowl-
edge scope of external data, to explore the potential applica-
tions of LLMs more extensively [19]. On the other hand,
LLMs can serve as crucial components in RAG, functioning
as the decision maker, reasoner, generator, or even evaluating
certain aspects of RAG [20, 21].
2.2 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG is a technical framework that enhances NLP systems by
integrating external knowledge retrieval, whose core innova-
tion enables extra non-parametric optimization of parameter-
fixed neural language models after training, e ffectively ex-
panding their operational domains while maintaining archi-
tectural stability [22]. Prior to the widespread adoption of
LLM, scholarly investigations had already established meth-
ods for enhancing NLP tasks through external knowledge in-
fusion [23]. Initial researches on RAG adhered to an ele-
mentary indexing and reading paradigm [24, 25]. Later for-
mulations delineated two core components: (1) the retriever,
which identifies, indexes, filters, and structures relevant knowl-
edge fragments from external data sources; (2) the generator,
which synthesizes the curated segments through analysis and
logical reasoning to produce outputs [9]. Figure 1 shows the
workflow of an RAG system with recommendations of com-
ponents implementation using LLMs at present. We provide
a concise description of each module's process below.
The retrieval component of RAG systems is inspired by
the retrieval technologies in multiple domains, such as infor-
mation retrieval [26], open-domain question answering [27],
and recommender systems [28, 29]. Before the retrieval, it is
necessary to construct a suitable corpus for the retrieval com-
ponent at the beginning. The sources of data are diverse, such
as domain-specific datasets like Wikipedia, specialized cor-
pora (e.g., scientific articles, financial reports) [30], or real-
time data gathered from web scraping or search engines [31].
The corpus is subsequently filtered and preprocessed to con-
form to the retrieval-friendly structure via o ffline chunking
and embedding. Chunking involves segmenting large doc-
uments into smaller, more manageable units guided by the
original structure or context information [32-34]. Embed-
ding (or text vectorization) aims to represent the textual con-

tent in a high-dimensional, dense semantic space for efficient
retrieval computation [5, 35].
Typically, RAG assessments convert the task into a con-
versational format of Question Answering (QA) comprising
question and the ground-true answers with doc candidates
[36, 37]. In the online RAG workflow, some additional com-
ponents are introduced before the retrieval, such like intent
recognition, query rewriting and routing [38]. The retriever
then indexes document collections from the data source. In
this core step, multiple retrieval strategies can be employed,
including sparse retrieval, dense retrieval, graph retrieval or
hybrid methods [6, 39]. Certain systems conduct additional
dynamic searches through search engines, typically found in
commercialized products. Some systems may introduce an
extra post-retrieval step to rerank the documents or fuse the
data scross different sources [7,40]. In the generation pipeline,
the responding progress based on the relevant documents is
assigned to the LLM, which serves primarily as a decision-
maker or reasoner [8]. Instead of generating knowledge in-
dependently, the LLM synthesizes retrieved information to
form coherent responses, thereby reducing the risk of inter-
nal hallucination. Additionally, a range of methods of prompt
engineering are available, including CoT [18], ToT [41], Self-
Note [42] and RaR [43], etc. Depending on the specific task
and expected output, a post-processing step may be required
after the knowledge-oriented response, such as Entity Recog-
nition for multi-choice questions or classification task, and
the translation component for multilingual task. Moreover,
the utility of the model's application is a point of concern,
particularly regarding safety and efficiency [44].
2.3 Related Surveys
Li et al. [23] summerrized and formalized the key definitions
of RAG while providing a synthesis of early-stage method-
ologies and practical applications. Expanding the scope be-
yond NLP, Zhao et al. [45] traced the developmental trajec-
tory of multimodal RAG across the broader AIGC landscape.
The emergence of LLM has since triggered an accelerated
development of RAG methods, with numerous survey papers
emerging to document this growing research domain [1,9,19,
20, 46]. Current researches mainly focus on collecting meth-
ods or applications, but lack substantive discussion about sys-
tematic evaluation mechanisms. While Yu et al. [21] pro-
vided an initial review outlining conceptual approaches for
RAG evaluation, their analysis was predominantly confined
to mainstream the frameworks, offering limited insights into
emerging assessment methods applicable to diverse contexts.
Building upon previois foundational work, this comprehen-
sive survey extends beyond these limitations, offering deeper
insights into emerging evaluation methods.
This study extends the research [21] by incorporating a
broader array of RAG evaluation methods within a systems
theory context. We di fferentiate between internal and exter-
nal evaluations: the former examines the RAG component
assessments and their interactive processes within the system
architecture, while the latter focuses on holistic system eval-
uation and environmental considerations, where environment
specifically denotes the external tasks or particular evaluation
contexts. We extend our horizons beyond collecting concep-
tual definitions of evaluation methods to exploring and ana-
4 Front. Comput. Sci., 2025, 0(0): 1-18
lyzing their practical application in the actual RAG studies.
Simultaneously, we focuses on RAG evaluation in LLM con-
texts, prioritizing unstructured text retrieval as the prevail-
ing paradigm. Domain-specific variants of RAG evaluation
(e.g., knowledge graph, multimodal retrieval) are excluded
due to fundamental architectural gaps. Unless otherwise in-
dicated, all the 'RAG' hereafter pertain to the narrow opera-
tional training-free framework employing unstructured docu-
ments as external knowledge resources.
3 Internal Evaluation
In this section, we summarize and organize the evaluations of
the internal components with their interactions within a RAG
system from prior studies. We deconstruct the evaluation of a
whole RAG system, focusing on internal component interac-
tions. A range of evaluation approaches are then introduced,
from traditional to new ones. The elements mentioned and
the implication of internal evaluation point to a framework
for evaluating the strengths of the RAG system's core func-
tionality, that is, generating accurate and credible output.
3.1 Evaluation Target
The diverse components of the RAG system can be boiled
down to solving two core problems: the retrieval of the ground
truth, and the generation of the response that closely aligns
with the gold answer. They correspond to the respective eval-
uation objectives of the retrieval and generation modules.
Figure 2 summarizes the evaluation targets of the retrieval
and generation component. The retrieval component includes
two main stages, recall and ranking. The outputs, relevant
documents, for both are similar to evaluate. Then we can con-
struct several pairwise relationships for the retrieval compo-
nent by defining the target as follows:
Relevance (Relevant Documents↔Query) evaluates how
well the retrieved documents match the information needed
expressed in the query. It measures the precision and speci-
ficity of the retrieval process.
Comprehensiveness (Relevant Documents↔Relevant Doc-
uments) evaluates the diversity and coverage of the retrieved
documents. This metric assesses how well the system cap-
tures a wide range of relevant information, ensuring that the
retrieved documents provide a comprehensive view of the
topic according to the query.
Correctness (Relevant Documents↔Documents Candi-
dates) assesses how accurate the retrieved documents are in
comparison to a set of candidate documents. It is a measure of
the system's ability to identify and score relevant documents
higher than less relevant or irrelevant ones.
The similar pairwise relations and targets for the genera-
tion component are outlined below.
Relevance (Response ↔Query) measures how well the
generated response aligns with the intent and content of the
initial query. It ensures that the response is related to the
query topic and meets the query's specific requirements.
Faithfulness (Response ↔Relevant Documents) evalu-
ates how the generated response accurately reflects the infor-
mation contained in the relevant documents and measures the
consistency between the generated and source documents.
Correctness (Response ↔Sample Response) Similar to
the accuracy in the retrieval component, this measures the ac-
curacy of the generated response against a sample response,
which serves as a ground truth. It checks if the response is
correct in terms of factual information and appropriate in the
context of the query.
3.2 Conventional Evaluation Methods
RAG is a cross-disciplinary system founded on traditional re-
search fields including information retrieval (IR) and natu-
ral language generation (NLG). Adhering to the conventional
methods of them, numerous traditional metrics are employed
to evaluate the retrieval and generation of RAG as follows.
3.2.1 IR-related Metrics
The IR-related metrics refer to the indicators associated with
conventional retrieval systems. These metrics are categorized
into two groups based on their correlation to ranking:
•Non-rank-based Metrics
The non-rank-based metrics typically evaluate binary outcomes,
that is, whether an item is relevant or not, without taking into
account the item's position in a ranked list.
Accuracy/Hit@K is the proportion of true results (both
true positives and true negatives) among the cases examined.
Accuracy = T P+ T N
TotalNumber
where T Pis the number of true positives, T Nis the number
of true negatives in the response.
Fig. 2 The evaluation target of the Retrieval and Generation component in RAG.
Aoran GAN et al. Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation in the Era of LLMs 5
Recall@K is the portion of relevant instances that have
been retrieved over the total amount of relevant cases, con-
sidering only the top k results.
Recall = |RD ∩Top kd|
|RD|
where RD is the relevant documents, and Top kd is the top-k
retrieved documents.
Precision@K is the fraction of relevant instances among
the retrieved instances, considering only the top k results.
Precision = T P
T P+ FP
where T Prepresents true positives and FP represents false
positives, respectively.
F1 Scoremeasures the balance between precision and re-
call, defined as the Harmonic Mean of the two.
F1 = 2 ×Precision ×Recall
Precison + Recall
•Rank-Based Metrics
The rank-based metrics focuse on the sequential presentation
of relevant items, assigning greater significance to the posi-
tioning of these items within the ranking list.
MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) is the average of the recip-
rocal ranks of the first correct answer for a set of queries.
MRR = 1
|Q|
|Q|X
i=1
ranki
where |Q|is the number of queries and ranki is the rank posi-
tion of the first relevant document for the i-th query.
NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) accounts
for the position of the relevant documents by penalizing rele-
vant documents that appear lower in the search results [47].
NDCG@k = DCG@k
IDCG@k
where DCG@k is the Discounted Cumulative Gain at rank k
and IDCG@k is the Ideal Discounted Cumulative Gain at
rank k, which represents the maximum possible DCG@k.
DCG@k is defined as:
DCG@k =
kX
i=1
2reli −1
log2(i + 1)
with reli being the graded relevance of the result at positioni.
MAP (Mean Average Precision) is the mean of the average
precision scores for each query.
MAP = 1
|Q|
|Q|X
q=1
Pn
k=1(P(k) ×rel(k))
|relevant documentsq|
where P(k) is the precision at cuto ff k in the list, rel(k) is an
indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rankk is a relevant
document in the n retrieved documents, 0 otherwise.
3.2.2 NLG-related Metrics
The NLG-related metrics focus on the content of the text out-
put, dedicated to the evaluation on the char or semantic level.
EM (Exact Match) is a simple, stringent and widely-used
evaluation metric that assesses the accuracy of model-generated
answers compared to the ground truth. It scores as 1 if a gen-
erated answer precisely aligns with the standard otherwise 0.
Typically, the responses need standardization and preprocess-
ing (e.g., conversion to lowercase, removal of punctuation,
elimination of articles, and standardization of number for-
mats) before comparison. A general approach involves com-
bining EM and Precision/ Recall / F1 or edit distance [48,49].
ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evalu-
ation) [50] is a set of metrics designed to evaluate the quality
of summaries by comparing them to human-generated refer-
ence summaries. ROUGE can be indicative of the content
overlap between the generated text and the reference text.
The variants of ROUGEs measure the overlap of n-grams
(ROUGE-N, ROUGGE-W), word subsequences (ROUGE-L,
ROUGGE-S), and word pairs between the system-generated
summary and the reference summaries.
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) [51] is a metric
for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text against
one or more reference translations. BLEU calculates the pre-
cision of n-grams in the generated text compared to the ref-
erence text and then applies a brevity penalty to discourage
overly short translations. Beyond machine translation evalua-
tion, BLEU can also be used for supervised comparison eval-
uation for general natural language generation. BLEU has
limitations, such as not accounting for the fluency or gram-
maticality of the generated text.
METEOR [52] is a metric designed to assess the quality
of machine translation or text generation. It enhances BLEU
by incorporating mechanisms like synonymization, stemming
matching, and word order penalties, demonstrating a stronger
correlation with results obtained from manual evaluations.
METEOR is defined as:
METEOR = (1 −p)(α2 + 1)Precision ×Recall
Recall + αPrecision ,
where αis the balanced factor, andp is the penalization factor
for word order.
BertScore [53] leverages the contextual embedding from
pre-trained transformers like BERT to evaluate the semantic
similarity between generated text and reference text. BertScore
computes token-level similarity using contextual embedding
and produces precision, recall, and F1 scores. Unlike n-gram-
based metrics, BertScore captures the meaning of words in
context, making it more robust to paraphrasing and more sen-
sitive to semantic equivalence. It has multiple variants, in-
cluding backbone advanced pre-trained models (e.g. BERT,
RoBERTa and BART) and supervised evaluation based on ex-
ternal classifier design.
Textual Similaritymeasures the semantic variety in re-
trieved documents. It can be calculated using metrics like
6 Front. Comput. Sci., 2025, 0(0): 1-18
Intra-Document Similarityor Inter-Document Similarity, which
assess the similarity between documents within a set.
Similarity = 1
|D|2
|D|X
i=1
|D|X
j=1
sim(di,dj)
where D is the set of retrieved documents, di and dj are em-
beddings of individual documents, and sim(di,dj) is a simi-
larity measure (e.g.,the most commonly used cosine similar-
ity) between the two documents.
Coverage measures the proportion of relevant documents
retrieved from the total number of relevant documents avail-
able in the dataset. It quantifies how comprehensively the
system captures all pertinent information across the corpus,
across topics, categories, or entities defined by humans or in
the knowledge base.
Coverage = |RD ∩Retrieved|
|RD|
where RD is the set of relevant documents and the notation
Retrieved is the set of retrieved documents. The coverage
can also be calculated at the group level, where the relevant
documents are grouped into different categories or topics.
Coverage = |Relevant Groups ∩Retrieved Groups|
|Relevant Groups|
Perplexity (PPL) gauges a language model's predictive
prowess, illustrating its level of uncertainty concerning test
data. Essentially, it is an exponential variation of cross-entropy,
quantifying the model's fit to the probability distribution of
the text. It is defined base on the generative LM output as
Perplexity = exp
−1
N
NX
i=1
log p(wi|w1,w2,..., wi−1)
.
It's important to note that the IR-related and NLG-related
methods are not directly equivalent to retrieval and generation
assessment methods. In RAG systems, retrieval and genera-
tion operations typically alternate. For instance, the query un-
derstanding and document fusion component are considered
as pre- and post-retrieval operations in the retriever, respec-
tively, yet the evaluation is sometimes based on the NLG-like
methods. SCARF [54] used BLEU / ROUGE to evaluate the
query relevance of the retriever. Blagojevic et al. [40] uti-
lized cosine similarity to assess the retrieval diversity. Addi-
tionally, the metrics can be adapted into various designs with
new label based on the specific subject of study, such as Ed-
itDist [55], Fresheval [56], etc.
3.2.3 Upstream Evaluation
Given the rapid advancement of RAG systems, it is crucial
to emphasize the significance of o ffline preprocessing of the
corpus. We supplement the evaluation method of preprocess-
ing modules, including chunking and embedding.
The evaluation of chunking methods can be conducted at
two levels. First, chunk-specific evaluation focuses on in-
trinsic metrics such as Accuracy, measured by Full Keyword
Coverage-the percentage of required keywords present in at
least one retrieved chunk-and the Tokens To Answermet-
ric, which tracks the index of the first fully comprehensive
chunk and cumulative token count needed for full context
coverage [57]. Second, extrinsic evaluation analyzes how dif-
ferent chunking approaches influence retrieval performance
on downstream tasks. For example, [34] and [58] evaluate
chunking methods by comparing retrieval recall, precision,
and response quality using metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and
F1 scores against ground truth evidence paragraphs, while
considering computational overhead. Other works extend this
evaluation using domain-specific datasets, such as financial
reports [57], to observe how structure-based and semantic
chunking improves retrieval accuracy while reducing latency
and token usage during inference.
Before retrieval, the embedding model determines the ac-
tual performance of retrieving relevant documents. Compre-
hensive benchmarks like Massive Text Embedding Bench-
mark (MTEB) [59] and Massive Multicultural Text Embed-
ding Benchmark (MMTEB) [60] have become standard for
the evaluation of embedding models. MTEB introduced the
first large-scale benchmark covering 8 embedding tasks across
58 datasets and 112 languages, establishing that no single
embedding method excels across all tasks. MMTEB sig-
nificantly expanded this work through a community-driven
effort, encompassing over 500 evaluation tasks across 250 +
languages and introducing novel challenges like instruction
following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval.
Although the models of chunking and embedding have
broad applications, they primarily serve as an upstream com-
ponent of the retriever in RAG. The primary benefit to the en-
tire system, involving chunking and embedding, is reflected
in the enhancement of the retriever's evaluation metrics.
3.3 Evaluation Methods via LLMs
The advancement of LLM has catalyzed refined investiga-
tions into RAG system architectures. Contemporary studies
increasingly employ LLM-driven assessment metrics, which
establish quantifiable benchmarks for iterative improvements
across different RAG modules. They can be broadly catego-
rized into the output and representation based methods.
3.3.1 LLM Output based Methods
The LLM-output based evaluation methods perform content
identification or statistical analysis of the text-format output
of the RAG components assumed by the LLM. These meth-
ods feature a concise and easily understandable process with-
out restrictions regarding whether the LLM is open or closed.
The most straightforward approach is to instruct the LLM
to explicitly evaluate or score the textual output of the compo-
nent by prompt engineering. Methods like RAGAS [61] and
Aoran GAN et al. Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation in the Era of LLMs 7
Databricks Eval [62] prompt GPT-based judges with explicit
instructions, such as "Check if the response is supported by
the retrieved context. "or "Assess completeness with respect
to the user query. "Zhang et al. [63] utilized GPT-4 with a
few-shot prompt design to determine whether the generated
answer matches the gold ones comprehensively. Finsås et
al. [64] implemented a multi-agent LLM framework to eval-
uate the retrieval performance and reported a higher relevance
with the human preference than the traditional methods. Patil
et al. [65] proposed an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based
method to measure the hallucination in RAG, which indicates
the accuracy of calling external APIs in the RAG system.
These methods typically benefit from CoT reasoning.
In addition, numerous researchers have proposed novel
definitions of statistical metrics derived from the LLM out-
put, facilitating a multi-perspective approach to evaluating
the RAG components.
Dai et al. [66] proposed a new metric Semantic Perplexity
(SePer) to capture the LLM's internal belief about the cor-
rectness of the generated answer. Given the query q and the
reference answers a∗, SePer is defined as the output sequence
likelihood with clustered entity target as:
S ePerM(q,a∗) = PM(a∗|q) ≈
X
Ci∈C
k(Ci,a∗)pM(Ci |q),
where M is the specific LLM. Cis the cluster set that the an-
other clustering model groupes the responses into. pM(Ci |
q) means the probability that a response generated by M is
mapped to the cluster Ci. k(Ci,a∗) is a simple kernal fuc-
tion to measure the distance between the meaning of semantic
cluster Ci and a∗ by utilizing char-level matching or simply
asking the LLM to get a True / False response.
Qi et al. [67] introduced the key point extraction to the
RAG evaluation and designedKPR metric to evaluate the ex-
tent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the
retrieved documents into their generated responses:
KPR(·) = 1
|Q|
X
q∈Q
P
x∈xq I(x,M(q∥dq))
|xq| ,
where Q is the global query set, and I(x,M(q∥dq)) is a fuc-
tion to judge whether a single LLM output sequenceM(q∥dq)
based on the queryq and the recalled documentsdq entails the
predefined key points xq.
To evaluate the inconsistency of the different retrievers in
RAG, Li et al. [68] proposed a pair of naive metrics called
Mean Relative Win /Lose Ratio (MRWR /MRLR). Given M
different retrievers R= {r1,r2,..., rM}and the dataset with N
query & answer pairs, the correctness of model response for
each sample <qn,an >is first cauculated, denoted byIm(n) =
1 if the retriever rm answers correctly on sample sn otherwise
0. Then the Relative Win Ratio (RWR) of retriever ri over
another retriever rj is defined as:
RWR(i, j) =
PN
n=1 Ii(n) ∗(1 −Ij(n))
PN
n=1 1 −Ij(n)
,
which represents the proportion of questions answered incor-
rectly by retrieverrj that were correctly answered by retriever
ri. MRWR and MRLR are calculated by respectively averag-
ing RWR across rows and columns among the retrievers:
MRWR(i) = 1
M −1
X
j,i
RWR(i, j),
MRLR(i) = 1
M −1
X
j,i
RWR(j,i).
Especially, MRLR(i) = 0 implies that retrieverri consistently
outperforms all of the other ones.
Min et al. [69] proposedFactScoreto messure whether the
generated content matches the given knowledge source by
breaking the generations into atomic facts. Chiang et al. [70]
further consideder the synonym expression and proposed the
advanced D-FAatScore. FactScore is a simple statistical de-
termination whether the factual contenta in the generated text
y matches the external knowledge base C:
FS(y) = 1
|Ay|
X
a∈Ay
I[a is supported by C].
D-FActScorelinks synonymous entities into the same cluster
Ayi and consider a cluster-level evaluation:
DFS(y) = 1
|Ay|
X
Ayi ∈Ay
X
a∈Ayi
I[a is supported by C∗
i ].
To evaluate the risk in the generator's response, Chen et
al. [71] introduced the divided cases of the generated an-
swer, answerable(A) and unanswerble(U), along with the dif-
ferent prediction process in the RAG system, keep(K) and
discard(D). Four risk-aware evaluation metrics from various
aspects are defined as:
1) Risk that measures the proprotion of risky casess among
the kept samples:
Risk = |UK|
|AK|+ |UK|
2) Care f ulnessindicates the percentage of incorrect and dis-
carded samples that are equivalent to recall for the unanswer-
able samples:
Care f ulness= |UD|
|UK|+ |UD|
3) Alignment refers to the proportion of samples in which the
system's judgment align with the assigned labels:
Alignment = |AK|+ |UD|
|AK|+ |AD|+ |UK|+ |UD|
4) Coverage quantifies the proportion of samples retained:
Coverage = |AK|+ |UK|
|AK|+ |AD|+ |UK|+ |UD|

3.3.2 LLM Representation based Methods
The representation-based methods, conversely, captures valu-
able metrics by modeling vector representation in the inter-
mediate or final layers of the LLM. These methods can mit-
igate overreliance on surface lexical patterns, but they may
lose interpretability since the final numeric similarity does
not necessarily clarify which factual detail is correct or not.
Certain methods are inspired by the conventional metrics,
demonstrated as expansions of existing metrics on the LLM.
For instance, GPTScore [72] is a GPT based LLM-scoring
method inspired by BertScore, which has been widely used
as a convincing metric. ARES [73] combined a classifier with
LLM embeddings to check whether a generative answer is se-
mantically aligned with ground-truth evidence. RAGAS [61]
uses a cosine similarity approach on LLM-generated embed-
dings to gauge answer relevance.
Moreover, numerous researchers have developed novel rep-
resentation based metrics, which serve not only to evaluate
the components but also to guide the further enhancement.
Zhao et al. [74] introduced a novel metric, Thrust, which
assesses the LLM's knowledgeability by leveraging the repre-
sentation distribution of the instances produced by the LLM.
A hypothesis was proposed that if an LLM has acquired ad-
equate knowledge pertaining to a task, it should e ffectively
cluster samples related to that task through its hidden states.
The Thrust metric was defined as:
sthrust(q) =
N ·K
NX
l=1
KX
k=1
|Ckl|
∥dkl(q)∥2 · dkl(q)
∥dkl(q)∥
,
where N is the number of classes for the specific task, K is
the number of clusters per class, |Ckl|denotes the cardinality
of the set. dkl(q) is a vector pointing from the representacion
of the query to the centroid.
Zhu et al. [75] introduced the information bottleneck the-
ory into retrieval component to messure the relevance of the
recalled document and candidate document. Moreover, a new
information bottleneck-based loss function was derived and
used to train a better noise filter for the retriever. Given the
sample {q,x,y}from the dataset and the noise filter p( ˜x|x,q)
(need tuning), the information bottleneck in the RAG task is
derived and formulated as:
IB( ˜x) = PLLM(x|[q, ˜x,y]) −αPLLM(y|[q, ˜x]),
where [·] means the concatenation operation. PLLM means
the final output probability of the LLM.
Li et al. [76] proposed a new metric GECE based on ME-
TEOR for assessing the extent of the long-tailness of the gen-
erated text in RAG:
GECE =
|METEOR(pred,re f) −1
n
Pn
i=1 PLLM (ti)|
α·[E(▽ins) ·▽ins] ,
where αis the average word frequency, ▽ins and E(▽ins) are
the gradient w.r.t. the current instance and the mean gradient
of the total dataset, separately. A long-tail instance usually
has a smaller α and ▽ins, obtaining a larger GECE , which
implies larger degree of long-tailness.
To assess the extent to which external knowledge is uti-
lized in the RAG response, Sun et al. [77] proposed External
Context Score E, which is defined on the response level as:
El,h
r = 1
|r|
X
t∈r
El,h
t = 1
|r|
X
t∈r
e ·xL
t
∥e∥∥xL
t ∥,
where |r|means the length of the response r, xL
t is the t-th
token's vector logit of the last layer L. e is a pooled vector
of the most relevant vectors of xL
t according to the attention
weights in the middle layer:
e = 1
|Il,h
t |
X
j∈Il,h
t
xL
j ,
where Il,h
t means the attended times where the token has
larger than top-k% attention scores with xL
t in the l-th layer.
Noted that some of these LLM based evaluation metrics
represent research specializations. While they may not be di-
rectly targeted towards an actual RAG system, their presen-
tation is an integral part of advancing researches in the field
of RAG, indicating significant contributions as well.
4 External Evaluation
We have dissected the components of RAG and provided a
comprehensive account of its internal evaluation. This sec-
tion shifts our focus tothe external utility that RAG, as a com-
plete system, encounters. We summarize the external utility
in two areas: safety and e fficiency, the evaluation of whom
are introduced below.
4.1 Safety Evaluation
Safety pertains to the RAG system's capacity to ensure the
generation of stable and harmless content within a dynamic,
even noisy or hazardous environment. As RAG systems con-
tinue widespread deployment, safety concerns have intensi-
fied beyond those of standalone LLMs. The incorporation of
external knowledge sources introduces unique vulnerabilities
requiring specialized evaluation frameworks [20].
Robustness evaluations focus on system behavior when
processing misleading information in retrieval results. The
RECALL benchmark [78] tests discrimination between reli-
able and counterfactual knowledge using BLEU, ROUGE-L,
and specialized metrics like Misleading Rate. Wu et al. [79]
quantify susceptibility to semantically related but irrelevant
information using Misrepresentation Ratio and Uncertainty
Ratio. SafeRAG [80] categorizes challenges like "inter-context
conflict" with specific evaluation metrics, while C-RAG [81]
provides theoretical guarantees on generation risks using con-
formal risk analysis and ROUGE-L. Cheng et al. [82] intro-
duce two metrics to evaluate the RAG system: 1) Resilience
Aoran GAN et al. Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation in the Era of LLMs 9
Rate, aiming to emphases the system's stability and robust-
ness, quantifies the percentage of instances where the sys-
tem's responses remain accurate, both prior to and follow-
ing retrieval augmentation. 2) Boost Ratequantifies the pro-
portion of instances initially answered erroneously that were
subsequently corrected upon the introduction of a retrieved
document, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG.
Factuality focuses on generating accurate information and
avoiding plausible but incorrect statements (hallucinations),
especially with noisy or conflicting retrieval results [78, 83,
84]. Key metrics include Factual Accuracy, using standard
QA metrics (EM, F1, accuracy, etc.) when the context might
be misleading [78]; the Hallucination Rate, the frequency of
generated information not supported by or contradicting re-
trieved documents, often measured via LLM-as-judge [85] or
human evaluation; Citation Accuracy, assessing correct attri-
bution to sources using Citation Precisionand Citation Re-
call [20, 85]; and Faithfulness Metrics, evaluating how accu-
rately the output reflects retrieved information [83].
Adversarial attackstarget specific components within the
RAG pipeline. Knowledge database poisoning (PoisonedRAG
[86]) targets the retrieval corpus by injecting malicious texts
that trigger predetermined outputs when retrieved. This at-
tack vector is evaluated using Attack Success Rate (ASR)
and retrieval-focused Precision/Recall/F1 metrics. Retrieval
hijacking (HijackRAG [87]) exploits ranking algorithms to
prioritize malicious content during retrieval, with evaluation
focusing on attack transferability across models. Phantom at-
tacks [88] use trigger-activated documents evaluated through
Retrieval Failure Rate (Ret-FR), while jamming attacks [89]
insert 'blocker' documents that force response refusal, as-
sessed through oracle-based metrics.
Privacy assess information exposure risks from retrieval
databases or user queries [90]. Evaluation often involves sim-
ulated attacks [91,92]. Key metrics about privacy include the
Extraction Success Rate, the frequency or success rate of at-
tacks extracting specific private information (e.g., names, PII)
from the knowledge base, often measured by the count of
successfully extracted items [90]; the PII Leakage Rate, the
amount or percentage of Personally Identifiable Information
inadvertently revealed in generated outputs, typically found
via pattern matching or inspection [93]; and the Membership
Inference Attack Success, which measures an attacker's abil-
ity to determine if a specific data record was in the RAG sys-
tem's knowledge base.
Fairness examines if the RAG system exhibits or ampli-
fies biases from retrieved documents or training, leading to
inequitable outputs [94]. Bias Metrics are used to analyze
the outputs for disparities, which are quantitative measures
of performance disparities (e.g., error rates, sentiment scores)
across demographic groups [94]. Stereotype Detectionmea-
sures the frequency or severity of harmful stereotypes in gen-
erated text, assessed via lists or human evaluation. Coun-
terfactual Fairnesschecks if outputs change inappropriately
when sensitive attributes in queries or context are altered.
Transparency / Accountability assesses the understand-
ability and traceability of the RAG system's reasoning pro-
cess, enabling verification of sources and justification [95,
96]. Metrics are often qualitative or user-focused, such as
Explanation Quality, based on human ratings of the clarity,
completeness, and usefulness of explanations or provenance
information [96]; Traceability, the ease of linking the final
output back to specific source documents or passages; and
Citation Accuracy(precision/recall) [20].
Comprehensive safety benchmarks standardize evaluation
across multiple dimensions. SafeRAG [80] classifies attack
tasks into four categories with tailored datasets. VERA frame-
work [97] uses bootstrap sampling for confidence bounds on
safety metrics, while DeepTeam's red teaming approach [93]
identifies vulnerabilities through systematic testing. In addi-
tion, current research indicates defense mechanisms remain
insufficient against sophisticated attacks [86-88]. Evalua-
tions reveal significant vulnerabilities in current RAG sys-
tems [87, 88], underscoring the need for robust benchmarks
and metrics addressing the unique safety challenges arising
from the retrieval-generation interplay. Further efforts are re-
quired to evaluate the safety of RAG.
4.2 E fficiency Evaluation
Efficiency is another crucial aspect of RAG's utility, directly
linked to the real-world significance of a system's popularity,
cost, and effectiveness.
Latency evaluation typically focuses on two critical met-
rics. Time to first token (TTFT) [98] measures the time taken
by the system to produce its initial output token after receiv-
ing a query, which is particularly crucial for user experience
as it directly impacts perceived responsiveness. This met-
ric is especially important in interactive applications where
immediate feedback maintains user engagement. Addition-
ally, complete response time (total latency) measures the du-
ration from query submission to the generation of the entire
response. This encompasses retrieval time, processing time,
and generation time for all tokens. Hofstatte et al. [99] pro-
posed Single Query Latency that refers to the complete end-
to-end time taken to process a single query, including both
complete retrieval and generation phases.
Resources and Money Costevaluation of RAG systems is
another critical component for assessing the e fficiency. Cost
evaluation methodologies typically focus on quantifying both
direct expenditures and efficiency metrics that impact overall
system economics. The total cost of RAG systems can be
categorized into several key components [126]:
• Infrastructure Costs: Computing local resources for
embedding generation, vector database maintenance,
and LLM inference for open models.
• Token-based Expenses: API charges for external LLM
services based on input and output token usage.
• Storage Costs: Vector database hosting and mainte-
nance expenses that scale with corpus size.

integrates wide metrics (LLM judge)
• Operational Overhead: Human supervision, system main-
tenance, and regular updates to knowledge bases.
• Development Costs: Initial implementation, integra-
tion, and customization expenses.
For more details in the token-based expenses, LLM providers
such as OpenAI and Google o ffer token usage metrics that
track input and output token consumption during evaluation
processes. This approach calculates costs by multiplying to-
ken counts by their respective pricing rates [127]. Researchers
have developed metrics to evaluate the economic efficiency of
RAG implementations:
• Cost-Effectiveness Ratio: Measures performance im-
provement per unit of cost, allowing for standardized
comparison between different RAG configurations [127].
• Retrieval Precision ROI: Quantifies the economic re-
turn of improving retrieval precision by measuring the
reduction in irrelevant context processing costs [127].
This metric demonstrated that optimizing retrieval can
improve cost efficiency by up to around 50% through
reducing token consumption during LLM inference.
• User-Controllable Cost-Accuracy Tradeoffs: Su et al.
[128] propose evaluation methods using an interpretable
control parameter (α) that allows systematic assessment
of the relationship between retrieval costs and accu-
racy. This approach enables evaluating RAG systems
across a spectrum of cost constraints rather than at fixed
operating points.
• Comparative Cost Analysis: Methodologies for eval-
uating relative cost e fficiency between di fferent RAG
implementations for specific use cases, considering both
direct costs and long-term economic sustainability [129].
5 Resources
The evaluation methodologies previously examined are com-
prehensive, though not necessarily abundant. This section
systematically compiles, categorizes, and presents the imple-
mented RAG evaluation frameworks, benchmarks, analytical
tools, and datasets that have emerged in the large language
model era. To our knowledge, this compilation constitutes the
most exhaustive collection of RAG evaluation frameworks
currently documented in the literature.
Datasets. We compiled the benchmarks along with the as-
sociated datasets in recent years. Early works focus on static
general-purpose QA datasets (e.g., NQ [100], HotpotQA [101]),
providing well-established baselines but lack recency or do-
main specificity. Recent benchmarks counter these limita-
tions by 1) sourcing live news or rapidly updated online doc-
uments (e.g., RGB [85], MultiHop-RAG [7]) to test time-
sensitive capabilities; 2) curating domain-specific corpora in

(C) or Comprehensiveness, whereas generation (right) focuses on Faithfulness (F), Correctness (C), or Relevance (R). External evaluation targets (safety,
efficiency) or other statements appear in italics.

more in-depth system component evaluation.
Frameworks with Evaluation Methods. We compiled
and summarized the evaluation methods devised by exist-
ing frameworks, as illustrated in Table 2. These e fforts span
from initial, point-level researches [40, 99] to later, multi-
component evaluation tools and benchmarks [73, 131], en-
compassing a remarkably comprehensive collection of assess-
ment frameworks. The evaluation methods employed are var-
ied, encompassing both traditional [78, 132] and LLM-based
metrics [106, 110]. Additionally, there are frameworks that
facilitate safety-focused evaluations [85, 116], or are tailored
to specific downstream domains like document [55,125], tele-
com [113], medicine [107], etc. Referencing the component
evaluation objectives outlined in section 3.1, we categorize
and highlight the evaluation elements and specific metrics.

6 Discussion
6.1 Statistics and Analysis of RAG Evaluation
The proliferation of LLM has contributed to a significant di-
versification of RAG evaluation methods. Current researches,
while demonstrating comprehensive coverage of RAG eval-
uation dimensions, often subjectively assert their respective
utility statements. To assess the popularity of these evaluation
methods, we conducted a statistical analysis of the available
methods from a survey perspective. This can also be viewed
as a research-oriented simple meta-evaluation. We crawled
the collection of the papers since 2022 autumn with keywords
about RAG in the accepted papers of the high-level confer-
ences about NLP & AI, and extracted the component as well
as the evalauation metrics the papers focus and utilize. We
finally amassed a total of 582 PDF manuscripts. All the in-
cluded papers have undergone rigorous peer review, demon-
strating scholarly merit with complete experimental method-
ologies and logically structured evaluation procedures.
Research Focus. Figure 3 illustrates the statistical distri-
bution of evaluation methods used across the four di fferent
segments in RAG studies (Retrieval / Generation / Safety /
Efficiency). The data suggests a prevailing focus on internal
research and evaluation of RAG systems, as indicated by the
extensive coverage of the retrieval and generation processes.
In contrast, external evaluations, particularly those related to
safety, have garnered less attention.
Metric Preference. Word frequency counts were con-
ducted for the assessment metrics mentioned in the papers,
with the wordcloud displayed in Figure 4. Whenever a met-
ric is formally introduced in the body of a paper or reported in
the table of experimental results, its word frequency count is
set +1. We manually merged and mapped synonymous met-

rics in the same session and excluded the words with global
occurrences lower than twice. It is observed that traditional
metrics predominantly dominate the evaluation usage, while
LLM-based methods have not yet gained widespread accep-
tance among researchers. This phenomenon is attributed to
the simplicity and reliability of the conventional metrics. Con-
versely, the LLM-based methods often require more e ffort
and involve multiple settings that are di fficult to keep the
same across di fferent researches, such as the LLM version
and prompt design.
Trend of LLM Usage. Despite the potential issues with
LLM-based methods, there is an observable trend of increas-
ing application, as shown in Figure 5. 2024 H2 and 2025 H1
have the top two highest numbers. LLM judges are ultimately
capable of handling more complex designs, drawing closer to
real-world applications. LLM itself, additionally, has contin-
ued to evolve in recent years, with the performance progres-
sively improving, and the supported functions expanding.
6.2 Challenges and Future Directions
This section addresses several challenges inherent in contem-
porary RAG evaluation.
Limitations of LLM-based Methods. The current evalu-
ation design does not su fficiently address the timeliness and
the black-box nature inherent in the LLM. The method of
employing LLMs for assessments, particularly through di-
rect prompts, raises latent risk about stability and security.
Future research should focus on enhancing the robustness of
the evaluation process itself and minimizing the likelihood of
LLM errors in the RAG system.
Cost of Evaluation. The cost associated with the RAG
system has garnered attention. Nevertheless, a thorough eval-
uation remains expensive due to the vast scale of the tools
and datasets involved. Determining an e fficient method for
system evaluation, or striking a balance between cost and ef-
fectiveness, is one of the directions for future research.
Advanced Evaluation Methods. As LLMs continue to
evolve, the components of RAG systems are becoming more
diverse. Currently, many of these components are evaluated
using end-to-end RAG ontology metrics, with a lack of com-
prehensive functional decomposition evaluation or theoreti-
cal analysis. Concurrently, there remains untapped potential
in the functionalities of LLMs themselves. For instance, the
Aoran GAN et al. Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation in the Era of LLMs 13
evaluation about deep thinking models (e.g. openai-o1 [135])
along with the thinking process of LLMs in conjunction with
RAG's retrieval and generation process, is still inadequate.
These in-depth evaluation strategies require further research
and development in the future.
Comprehensiveness of the Evaluation Framework. De-
spite the abundant evaluation frameworks at present, individ-
ual ones are somewhat limited in their metrics and methods of
evaluation. Moreover, most contemporary frameworks con-
centrate on widely used languages such as English and Chi-
nese. There is an urgent need for frameworks that are not
only methodologically but also linguistically diverse.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented the first comprehensive sur-
vey of RAG evaluation methodologies in the LLM era. Our
systematic analysis reveals several important insights for re-
searchers and practitioners working with these increasingly
prevalent systems. For the evaluation of internal RAG per-
formance, we dissect the internal components of RAG sys-
tems, define the assessment objectives, and gather a range of
methods and metrics from traditional to innovative. More-
over, we investigate the external evaluation related to system
integrity such as safety and e fficiency, which are underex-
plored in RAG research according to our statistical analy-
sis. Additionally, we compile and categorize the current eval-
uation datasets and frameworks to elucidate the unique at-
tributes and assessment focuses of the resources. Last but not
least, we analyze the implementation of existing evaluation
methods and synthesize the challenges and future directions
of RAG evaluation in the LLM era.
