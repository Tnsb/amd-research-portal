Hadamard-type variation formulae for the eigenvalues of a
class of second-order elliptic operators and its applications
C. L. Cunha 1, J. N. Gomes 2 and M. A. M. Marrocos 3
Abstract. We use variational methods to derive Hadamard-type formula e
for the eigenvalues of a class of elliptic operators on a comp act Riemannian
manifold M. We then apply the latter in the following context. Consider a
family of elliptic operators which is parametrized by eithe r the set of all Cr-
Riemannian metrics on M or the set of all Cr-diﬀeomorphisms on a domain
into M. In either case we prove that if a subset of the parametrizati ons set
yields a simple spectrum of the operator, then it is necessar ily a generic subset.
We also analyse the behavior of the eigenvalues when the metr ic evolves along
the Ricci ﬂow on a closed Riemannian manifold, and we prove, u nder a suitable
hypothesis, that they increase.
1. Introduction
Let (Mn,g) be an n-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold with boundary
∂M, and let L be the class of elliptic diﬀerential operators given by
L f := div η(T∇f) := div( T∇f) − ⟨∇η,T ∇f⟩, (1.1)
where T is a symmetric positive deﬁnite (1 ,1)-tensor on Mn and f,η ∈ C∞(M).
Here, div stands for the divergence of smooth vector ﬁelds and ∇ for the gradient
of smooth functions. We allow both T and η depend on the metric g = ⟨,⟩.
This class of operators uniﬁes several particular cases that are w ell-studied in the
literature, e.g., the Laplace-Beltrami operator, the drifted Lapla cian, the Cheng-
Yau operator, among other geometric operators which naturally a rise in geometric
analysis. For instance, when T is divergence free, then the operator L is likely to
have applications in physics, see, e.g., Serre [ 19]. We highlight that Serre's work
deals with divergence free positive deﬁnite symmetric tensors and ﬂ uid dynamics,
there we can ﬁnd examples and know where these tensors occur. W e refer the
reader to Alencar, Neto and Zhou [ 1], Ara´ ujo Filho and Gomes [ 2], Gomes and
Miranda [ 9] or Navarro [ 18] for more related discussions.
In this paper, we study the behavior of the spectrum of L by means of
Hadamard-type variational formulae for its eigenvalues. It is orga nized as follows.
We give some preliminaries in Section 2 and some general comments on v aria-
tional formulae in Section 3. In Section 4, we consider the eigenvalue problem for
the operator Lg with the Dirichlet boundary condition. Theorem 1 deal with the

generic simplicity of the eigenvalues of the operator Lg(·) = div η(Tg∇·), where the
Tg-family satisﬁes the property P. A precise description of this latter property is
given in Section 5. Taking into account property P, we prove that all eigenvalues of
Lg are generically simple. The perturbation of the domain case is settled by Propo-
sition 6 in which the η-dependency on the parameter t is crucial. In Section 6, we
deal with the generic simplicity of the eigenvalues of the operator Lg with the Neu-
mann boundary condition. In Section 7, we deal with domain variation considering
both boundary conditions, Dirichlet and Neumann, and proving that the eigenval-
ues are generically simple. Especially, Theorem 2 shows that the multip licity of an
eigenvalue can be reduced by small perturbation of the domain. In S ection 8, we
deal with extremal metrics. A domain Ω is local minimizer (local maximize r) for
the kth-eigenvalue µk of L if for any analytic volume-preserving deformation Ω t,
the function t↦→µk(t) admits a local minimum (local maximum) at t= 0. For the
Dirichlet Laplacian case, it is known that if a domain is local minimizer (res p. local
maximizer) for µk with µk > µk−1 (resp. µk < µk+1), then the norm |∂φ/∂ν| of
the normal derivative of the eigenfunction φof µk is constant (see [ 20]). We prove
a similar result for L in Theorem 3. In Section 9, we analyze the behavior of the
eigenvalues of the operator Lg(t) along the Ricci Flow. For instance, we prove a
monotonicity for one-parameter family of eigenvalues λ(t) of Lg(t) along the Ricci
ﬂow on a closed homogeneous n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, see Theorem 4.
We also prove the monotonicity of the eigenvalues of div η(ψ∇u) envolving by the
Ricci ﬂow on three-dimensional Riemannian manifold having strictly po sitive Ricci
curvature initially, see Theorem 5. In particular, since the solution t o the Ricci ﬂow
becomes extinct in ﬁnite time, with additional hypothesis over the fu nction ψ, we
prove that lim
t→δ
λ(t) = ∞, see Theorem 6.
It is worth mentioning here some of the main articles related to our wo rk.
Uhlenbeck [21] showed that on a closed Riemannian manifold ( Mn,g) there exists a
residual subset Γ into Mr for which the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
∆ g is simple, where Mr, 2 ≤ r < ∞, stands for the set of all Cr-Riemannian
metrics g on Mn.
Canzani [ 5] considered elliptic, formally self-adjoint, conformally covariant op -
erator Pg of order macting on smooth sections over a closed Riemannian manifold
(Mn,g), and proved, under special conditions over the eigenspaces of Pg, that the
set of all functions f ∈ C∞(M) for which Pef g has only simple nonzero eigenvalues
is a residual subset of C∞(M).
El Souﬁ and Ilias [ 20] established necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a do-
main to be critical, locally minimizing or locally maximizing the kth-eigenvalue of
the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As an application they obtained a c haracteriza-
tion for critical domains of the trace of the heat kernel under Diric hlet boundary
condition.
Cao, Hou and Ling [ 6] showed a monotonicity Hadamard-type formula for the
ﬁrst eigenvalue of −∆ + aR (0 < a <1/2) on a closed surface with nonnega-
tive scalar curvature R under the Ricci ﬂow. Recall that, this latter ﬂow was
introduced by Hamilton [ 11] to study the geometry of positive Ricci curvature on
three-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds. Currently, the Ricc i ﬂow stands
as a powerful tool in studying the geometry and topology for lower dimensional
manifolds.

2. Preliminaries
Let dm = e−ηdM be the weighted volume form on ( Mn,g), d µ = e−ηdσ be
the weighted area form induced on ∂M, where dM is the Riemannian volume form
of g = ⟨,⟩, and η : M → R be a smooth function. If T is a (0 ,2)-tensor on Mn,
then we can associate it with a unique (1 ,1)-tensor, which will also be denoted T,
according to ⟨TX,Y ⟩ = T(X,Y ) for all X,Y ∈ X(M). Thus, for an (1 ,1)-tensor
S, we have
ST(X,Y ) = ⟨STX,Y ⟩ = S(TX,Y ).
Recall that the divergence of an (1 ,1)-tensor T is the (0 ,1)-tensor
(divT)(v)(p) = tr g
(
w↦→(∇wT)(v)(p)
)
,
for p∈ Mn and v,w ∈ TpM. Recall also that the inner product induced by gon the
space of (0 ,2)-tensors on Mn is ⟨T,S⟩ = tr g
(
TS∗)
, where S∗ denotes the adjoint
tensor of S. Clearly, we have in a local coordinates
⟨T,S⟩ = gikgjl TijSkl.
In this way, if ∇2f = ∇dfstands for the Hessian of f, then ∆ gf = ⟨∇2f,g⟩. Now,
we deﬁne the ( η,Tg)-divergence operator
Lgf = div( Tg∇f) − Tg(∇η,∇f) = eηdiv(e−ηT∇f),
where Tg is a symmetric positive deﬁnite (0 ,2)-tensor which depends smoothly on
g.
If we consider the drifted divergence operator div ηX := div X− ⟨∇η,X⟩, then
the ( η,Tg)-divergence operator takes the form Lgf = div η(T∇f), moreover, ap-
plying the divergence theorem, one has∫
M
divη(TX)dm =
∫
∂M
⟨TX,ν ⟩dµ,
where ν is the outward pointing unit normal vector ﬁeld along ∂M.
Since div η(T(fX)) = fdivη(TX) + ⟨∇f,TX ⟩ for f,ℓ ∈ C∞(M), we obtain
∫
M
ℓdivη(T∇f)dm = −
∫
M
Tg(∇ℓ,∇f)dm +
∫
∂M
ℓTg(∇f,ν)dµ (2.1)
and the following formulae hold
Lg(fℓ) = fLgℓ+ ℓLgf + 2Tg(∇f,∇ℓ).
It follows from (2.1) that ( η,Tg)-divergence operator is a formally self-adjoint
operator in the Hilbert space of all real functions f ∈ L2(M,dm) that vanish (or
Tg(∇f,ν) = 0) on ∂M in the sense of the trace. Thus, the Dirichlet (or Tg-
Neumann) boundary eigenvalue problem for Lg has real and discrete spectrum
0 = µ0(g) <µ1(g) ≤ µ2(g) ≤ · · · ≤ µk(g) ≤ · · · → ∞ ,
where each µi(g) is repeated according to its multiplicity. Moreover, since Mn is
compact there exist two positive constants α and β, such that
0 <α|Y|2 ≤ Tg(Y,Y ) ≤ β|Y|2,
for all Y ∈ X(M). Now, as Lg is a closed operator, we can use perturbation theory
for linear operators as in Kato [ 14].
Let Sr(M) be the Banach spaces of Cr-symmetric (0 ,2)-tensors on Mn, and
let Mr be the Banach spaces of Cr-Riemannian metrics on Mn, 2 ≤ r <∞. A
4 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
subset of Mr is called residual if it contains a countable intersection of open dense
sets. A property of metrics in Mr is called generic if it holds on a residual subset.
3. Variation formulae by means of the metrics
We start by considering t ↦→g(t) a smooth variation of an initial metric g.
Let dm t = e−ηdMt be the weighted volume form of g(t), and d µt = e−ηdσt be
the weighted area form induced on ∂M. Denoting by H the (0 ,2)-tensor given
by Hij = d
dt

⏐
t=0gij(t) and writing h = gijHij, we get d
dt dmt = 1
2 hdm. Similarly,
if ˜H stands for the (0 ,2)-tensor induced by the derivative of g(t) restricted to
∂M, and ˜h denotes its trace, then d
dt dµt = 1
˜hdµ. Since there is no danger of
confusion, we also write ⟨,⟩ for the metric g(t). Thus, for each X ∈ X(M), we can
write Xt = gij(t)xi(t)∂j , where xi(t) = ⟨X,∂i⟩, and we deﬁne ˙X := gijx′
i∂j , where
x′
i = d
dt xi(t).
Now, we consider t ↦→Tg(t) =: Tt to be a smooth variation of the initial
symmetric (0 ,2)-tensor T = Tg. Then, we obtain the identity
d
dtTt(Xt,Yt) = T( ˙X,Y ) + T(X, ˙Y) + HT (X,Y ), (3.1)
where
HT := −(TH + HT) + T′ and T ′(∂i,∂j ) = d
dtTt(∂i,∂j ) = ( Tt)′
ij .
Indeed, a straightforward computation gives us
Tt(Xt,Yt) = gij(t)gkl(t)xi(t)yk(t)(Tt)jl and d
dtgij(t) = −gir(t)gjs (t)Hrs(t).
Hence
d
dtTt(Xt,Yt) = gijgklx′
i(t)yk(t)(Tt)jl + gijgklxi(t)y′
k(t)(Tt)jl
− girgjsgklHrsxiyk(Tt)jl − gijgkrglsHrsxiyk(Tt)jl + gijgklxiyk(Tt)′
jl
which is enough to obtain (3.1).
In the special case of gradient vector ﬁelds, we denote by ∇tf the gradient of
f ∈ C∞(M) computed in the metric g(t). Observe that ∇tf = gij(t)fi∂j , where
fi = ⟨∇f,∂i⟩ = ∂if does not depend on t. Thus, from (3.1) we have
d
dtTt(∇tf,∇tℓ) = HT (∇f,∇ℓ) (3.2)
for all f,ℓ ∈ C∞(M). In particular,
d
dt⟨∇tf,∇tℓ⟩ = −H(∇f,∇ℓ).
Moreover, if we consider the smooth curve t ↦→ℓ(t) ∈ C∞(M) and the smooth
vector ﬁeld νt := ∇tf
|∇tf| , then
d
dtTt(νt,∇tℓ(t)) = 1
2H(ν,ν)T(ν,∇ℓ) + T(ν,∇ℓ′) + HT (ν,∇ℓ). (3.3)
Indeed, ﬁrst note that νi = 1
|∇f| ⟨∇f,∂i⟩ implies
ν′

and then
T( ˙ν,∇ℓ) = 1
2H(ν,ν)T(ν,∇ℓ).
Thus, by taking Xt = νt and Yt = ∇tℓ(t) into (3.1), we obtain (3.3).
Now, we consider a smooth function η : I× M → R and write ˙η := d
dt

to deﬁne
¯Ltφ:= div( Tt∇φ) − Tt(∇η(t),∇φ) (3.5)
for all φ∈ C∞(M). We observe that the family of operators ¯Lt is very convenient
to deal with domain deformations.
Lemma 1. For all f ∈ C∞

where ¯L ′ := d

Proof. We begin by considering η to be independent of t. In this case, ¯Lt
becomes Lt. Integration by parts formula gives us

Observe that
divη(HT (ℓ∇f)) = ℓdivη(HT ∇f) + HT (∇f,∇ℓ) (3.8)
and
divη(ℓhT∇f) = ℓhL f + ℓT(∇h,∇f) + hT(∇ℓ,∇f). (3.9)
Plugging (3.8) and (3.9) in (3.7), we obtain

ℓL ′fdm =

which is suﬃcient to prove (3.6) for this particular case. For the gen eral case, it is
enough to note that
¯L ′f = L ′f − T(∇ ˙η,∇f) (3.10)
to conclude the proof of the lemma. □
4. Hadamard-type variation formula
In what follows, we assume that all manifolds are oriented and those that are
compact we assume to have boundary. The closed manifolds are ass umed to be
compact without boundary.
As in the previous section, we continue by considering t↦→Tg(t) =: Tt a smooth
variation of the initial symmetric (0 ,2)-tensor T = Tg, and the family of operators
¯Lt as in (3.5), besides, we denote d¯mt = e−η(t)dMt.
The next result is an extension of Lemma 3 .15 in Berger [ 4] for the ( η,Tg)-
divergence operator Lg.
6 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
Lemma 2. Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold. Consider a real
analytic one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics g(t) on M with g= g(0). If
λ is an eigenvalue of multiplicity m> 1 for Lg, then there exist ε> 0, scalars λi
(i= 1 ,...,m ) and functions φi varying analytically in t, such that, for all |t| < ε
the following holds:
(1) λi(0) = λ;
(2) {φi(t)} is orthonormal in L2(M,d ¯mt);
(3)
{ ¯Ltφi(t) = λi(t)φi(t) in M
φi(t) = 0 on ∂M.
Proof. Write g(z) and Tz for the extensions of g(t) and Tt to a domain D0 of
the complex plane C, respectively. So, we can naturally extend the operator ¯Lt to
¯Lz := ¯La+ib = ¯La + i ¯Lb.
We observe that the domain D = H2(M) ∩ H1
0 (M) of ¯Lz do not depend on
z, and since M is compact, for any two Riemannian metrics g1,g2 the associated
Sobolev norms ||.||W 1,2 (M,gi) in H2(M) are equivalent. Moreover, the map z↦→ ¯Lzφ
is holomorphic for z ∈ D0 and for every φ∈ D. Thus, ¯Lz is a holomorphic family
of type ( A) as in Kato [ 14]. Once the family ¯Lz is not self-adjoint in its domain,
we can consider the isometry Pt : L2(M,dm) → L2(M,d ¯mt) given by
Pt(u) =
√
det(gij)

Evidently, ˜Lt share the same spectrum with ¯Lt. So, applying Theorem 3.9 in [ 14]
for the operator ˜Lt we obtain the families of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
the required properties. □
We now consider a smooth map F : Mr → S 2
+(M) that associates to each
g∈ M r a symmetric positive deﬁnite tensor F(g) = Tg. Naturally, dFg stands for
the diﬀerential of F at g, and dF∗
g for the adjoint of dFg. The next proposition
constitutes the ﬁrst Hadamard-type variational formula.
Proposition 1. Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold and g(t) be
a smooth variation of g. Consider {φi(t)} ⊂ C∞(M) a diﬀerentiable family of
functions and λi(t) a diﬀerentiable family of real numbers such that λi(0) = λ for
each i= 1 ,...,m and for all t{ − ¯Ltφi(t) = λi(t)φi(t) in M
φi(t) = 0 on ∂M,
with ⟨φi(t),φj (t)⟩L2(M,d ¯mt) = δij . Then, we have
(λi + λj )′δij =

where (T∇φi)♭ is the 1-form associated to T∇φi induced by g, and Sym is the
symmetrization operator.
Proof. Diﬀerentiating with respect to the variable t the equation
− ¯Ltφi(t) = λi(t)φi(t)
at t= 0, one has
− ¯L ′φi − ¯L φ′
i = λ′

Using integration by parts, we obtain

Now, we compute
HT (∇φi,∇φj )
= −T(H∇φi,∇φj ) − H(T∇φi,∇φj ) + ⟨T′,dφi ⊗ dφj ⟩
= ⟨−(T∇φi)♭ ⊗ dφj − dφi ⊗ (T∇φj )♭,H⟩+ ⟨dFg(H),Sym(dφi ⊗ dφj )⟩
= ⟨−(T∇φi)♭ ⊗ dφj − dφi ⊗ (T∇φj )♭ + (dFg)∗Sym(dφi ⊗ dφj ),H⟩.
We substitute this into (4.2) to complete the proof. □
We point out that Hadamard-type variation formula (4.1) generalize s the Berger
formula in [ 4]. Moreover, we highlight that equation (4.2) will be useful in diﬀerent
ways in this paper.
5. On generic properties of eigenvalues
Here, we give an application of the Hadamard-type formula that we h ave ob-
tained in the previous section.
Let F : Mr → S 2
+(M) be a smooth map that associates to each g ∈ M r
a symmetric positive deﬁnite tensor F(g) = Tg such that Lg(·) = div η(Tg∇·) is
uniformly elliptic. We say that the Tg-family satisﬁes the property P if, for all
g ∈ M r, the tensor Gg = ( n− 4)Tg + 2 dFg(g) satisﬁes either Gg(X,X) > 0 or
Gg(X,X) <0 or Gg(X,X) ≡ 0 for all X ∈ X(M). For example, if ψ is a positive
smooth function then Tg = ψg satisﬁes the property P.
8 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
Theorem 1. Let (M,g0) be a compact Riemannian manifold. Consider a
family of operators Lg(·) = div η(Tg∇·) where the Tg-family satisﬁes the property
P, and let λ be an eigenvalue of the problem
{ −Lg0 φ = λφ in M
φ = 0 on ∂M (5.1)
with multiplicity m >1. Then given any neighborhood U ⊂ M r of g0 and ǫ >0,
there exists g ∈ U and a simple eigenvalue λ(g) such that |λ(g) − λ(g0)| < ǫ. In
particular, the subset Γ ⊂ M r where the eigenvalues of (5.1) are simple, is residual.
Proof. We will argue by contradiction. Let U ⊂ M r be a neighborhood of
g0 such that ∀g∈ U with |λ(g) − λ(g0)| <ǫ the multiplicity of λ(g) is m. Consider
g(t) = g0 + tH, where H is any symmetric (0 ,2)-tensor on ( Mn,g(t)) with λ(t)
and φ(t) given by Lemma 2 such that
{ −Ltφi(t) = λ(t)φi(t) in M
φi(t) = 0 on ∂M.
By Proposition 1
λ′δij =

+dF∗
g0 Sym(dφi ⊗ dφj ). (5.2)
Furthermore, taking traces in equation (5.2), we get
0 = nL (φiφj ) − 8T(∇φi,∇φj ) + 4 dFg0 (g0)(∇φi,∇φj )
= −λnφiφj + ((n− 4)T + 2dFg0 (g0))(∇φi,∇φj ). (5.3)
We so obtain
λnφiφj = Gg(∇φi,∇φj ). (5.4)
Motivated by a similar argument given by Uhlenbeck [ 21] we ﬁx p∈ M and consider
an integral curve α in M such that α(0) = p and α′(s) = Gg∇φi(α(s)). Deﬁning
β(s) := φj (α(s)), we compute
β′(s) = ⟨∇φj (α(s)),α′(s)⟩ = Gg(∇φj ,∇φi)(α(s)) = λnφi(α(s))φj (α(s))
= λnφi(α(s))β(s).
This gives us that β(s) = cenλ
∫ s
0 φi(α(t))dt, where c >0. If Gg is positive, we have
that φi(α(s)) is increasing in s and then β(s) ր ∞ , which is a contradiction, since
M is compact. If Gg is negative the argument is analogous. If Gg ≡ 0, then from
equation (5.3) we get φiφj = 0, hence, by the principle of the unique continuation
[13] we have that at least one of the eigenfunctions vanishes, which is a gain a
contradiction. It proves the ﬁrst part of the theorem.
Now, let Γ m be the set of metrics g∈ M r such that the ﬁrst m eigenvalues of
Lg with respect to Problem (5.1) are simple. It is known that those eigen values
depend continually of the metric (see [ 3]), hence Γ m is open in Mr. On the other
ON EIGENV ALUES OF A CLASS OF SECOND ORDER ELLIPTIC OPERATORS 9
hand, it follows from the ﬁrst part of the theorem that Γ m is dense in Mr. Since Mr
is a complete metric space on the topology Cr, the set Γ = ∩∞
m=1Γ m is residual. □
6. Tg-Neumann boundary eigenvalue problem
Our goal in this section is to prove the generic properties for eigenv alues of the
operator L with the Neumann boundary condition. More speciﬁcally,
{ (L + λ)φ = 0 in M

Below we will obtain Hadamard-type formulas for the eigenvalues of L with
Tg-Neumann boundary condition.
Proposition 3. Let (M,g0) be a compact Riemannian manifold, and g(t) be
a smooth variation of g0. Consider {φi(t)} ⊂ C∞(M) a diﬀerentiable family of
functions and λi(t) a diﬀerentiable family of real numbers such that λi(0) = λ for
each i= 1 ,...,m and for all t
{ − ¯Lg(t)φi(t) = λi(t)φi(t) in M
Tt(νt,∇φi(t)) = 0 on ∂M,
which ⟨φi(t),φj (t)⟩L2(M,dmt) = δij. Then, we obtain the following variation formula
(λi + λj )′δij =

where (Tg0 ∇φi)♭ is the 1-form associated to Tg0 ∇φi induced by g0, and Sym denotes
the symmetrization operator.
Proof. Taking the derivative with respect to t in both sides of the identity
− ¯Lg(t)φi(t) = λi(t)φi(t),
one has at t= 0

Now, we will prove the existence of analytic curves of eigenvalues.
Proposition 4. Let (M,g0) be a compact Riemannian manifold and g(t) be a
real analytic one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics o n M with g(0) = g0.
Assume λis an eigenvalue of multiplicity mfor the operator Lg0 with Tg0 -Neumann
boundary condition. Then, there exist ε >0, and t-analytic functions λi(t) and
φi(t), with i= 1 ,...,m and |t| <ε, such that ⟨φi(t),φj (t)⟩L2(M,dmt) = δj
i , λi(0) = λ
and {
−Ltφi(t) = λi(t)φi(t) in M
Tt(∇φi(t),νt) = 0 on ∂M.
The following remark is due at this point. The main technique utilized in th e
proof of Proposition 4 is the Liapunov-Schmidt method. In particula r, we will fol-
low along the same lines of proof as in Henry [ 12], Marrocos and Pereira [ 17], and
Gomes and Marrocos [ 10], for they already successfully employed this method in
contexts similar to ours. The proof of Proposition 4 requires the fo llowing propo-
sition.
Proposition 5. Let (M,g0) be a compact Riemannian manifold, and λ0 be an
eigenvalue of multiplicity m >1 of the operator L with Tg0 -Neumann boundary
condition. Then for every ǫ >0 there is δ > 0 so that for each |t| < δ, there
exist exactly m eigenvalues (counting their multiplicities) to Problem (6.1) in the
interval (λ0 − ǫ,λ0 + ǫ).
Proof. Let {φj }m
j=1 be an orthonormal basis associated with λ0, and consider
the orthonormal projection on the corresponding eigenspace
Pu =
m∑
j=1
φj
∫
M
φj udm0.
Note that P induces the splitting L2(M,dm0) = R(P)⊕N (P) so that any function
u ∈ L2(M,dm0) can be written as u = φ+ ψ, where φ ∈ R (P) = ker(L + λ0)
and ψ ∈ N (P). With this in mind, we consider the family of metrics g(t) on M
and the family of eigenvalue problems, where the operator L remains ﬁxed and
the families Tt and νt change with the parameter t along the boundary,



(I− P)(L + λ)(φ+ ψ) = 0 in M
P(L + λ)(φ+ ψ) = 0 in M
Tt(νt,∇(φ+ ψ)) = 0 on ∂M.
(6.4)
12 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
To solve problem (6.4), we ﬁrst observe that since φj and ψ are orthonormal,
by the divergence theorem we must have
P(L + λ)ψ =
m∑
j=1
φj
∫
M
φj (L + λ)ψdm0

Thus, we get
(L + λ)ψ+ (I− P)(Lt − L )(φ+ ψ) −
m∑
j=1
φj
∫
∂M
φj T(∇ψ,ν)dµ0 = 0 .
Moreover, the part concerning the boundary in (6.4) can be rewrit ten as
T(ν,∇ψ) + Tt(νt,∇(φ+ ψ)) − T(ν,∇(φ+ ψ)) = 0 .
Hence, to solve the ﬁrst and the third equations of (6.4), is equivale nt to ﬁnding
the zeros of the map
F : R × R × R(P) × H2(M) ∩ N (P) − → N (P) × H

F2 = T(ν,∇ψ) + Tt(νt,∇(φ+ ψ)) − T(ν,∇(φ+ ψ)).
Note that F depends diﬀerentially on the variables λ, t, ψ e φ. Our intention is
to use the implicit function theorem to show that F(t,λ,φ,ψ ) = (0 ,0) admits a
solution ψ as function of λ, t and φ. To this end, we observe that if t= 0 ,λ = λ0
and ψ= 0, then

. (6.5)
We claim now that the map given in (6.5) is an isomorphism from H2(M) ∩ N (P)
onto N (P) × H
2 (M). Indeed, the proof of this fact can be found in [ 16].
Hence, by the implicit function theorem there exist positive numbers δ, ǫ and
a function S(t,λ)φ of class C1 at the variables ( t,λ) such that for every |t| <δ and
λ ∈ (λ0 − ǫ,λ0 + ǫ), F(t,λ,φ,S (t,λ)φ) = (0 ,0). Furthermore, S(t,λ)φ is analytic
at λ and linear at φ. This solves the equation (6.4) in relation to ψ.
ON EIGENV ALUES OF A CLASS OF SECOND ORDER ELLIPTIC OPERATORS 13
We now observe that for every φ∈ R (P) there exist real numbers c1,c2,...,c m
so that φ = ∑ m
j=1 cj φj . Thus, the second equation in (6.4) can be equivalently
perceived as a system of equations in the variables c1,...,c m as below
m∑
j=1
cj
∫
M
φk(Lt + λ)(φj + S(t,λ)φj )dm0 = 0 , k = 1 ,2,...,m.
In this way, λ is an eigenvalue of Lt if and only if det A(t,λ) = 0, where A(t,λ) is
given by
Akj (t,λ) =
∫
M
φk(Lt + λ)(φj + S(t,λ)φj )dm0.
Furthermore, the associated eigenfunctions are given by
u(t,λ) =
m∑
j=1
cj (φj + S(t,λ)φj ).
In other words, c = ( c1,...,c m) must satisfy A(t,λ)c = 0. It turns out that by
Rouch´ e theorem, we have that: For every ǫ> 0 there is δ >0 so that if |t− t0| <δ,
then there exist exactly m-roots of det A(t,λ) = 0 in the interval ( λ0 −ǫ,λ0 +ǫ). □
Proof of Proposition 4. Assume the same hypotheses as in Proposition 5.
We must show that there exist m analytic curves of eigenvalues λj (t) for (6 .1)
associated to m analytic curves of eigenfunctions φj (t). The strategy of proof is
to reduce the problem to a ﬁnite-dimensional one and to apply Kato's Selection
theorem, see [ 14]. With this in mind, we will make a slightly diﬀerent construction
than that of Proposition 5. This will result, as we will see shortly, in ob taining a
symmetric matrix.
Let {φj }m
j=1 be orthonormal eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Neumann operato r
associated with λ0. For each j = 1 ,...,m consider the following problem


φj udm0 = 0 in M.
(6.6)
Consider now the orthogonal complement [ φj ]⊥ of ker(L + λ0) in L2(M,dm0)
and deﬁne
F : ( −δ,δ) × H2(M,dm0) − →[φj ]⊥ × R(P) × H
2 (M,dm0)
by
F(t,w) =
(
(L + λ0)w, Pw, Tt(νt,∇(φj + w))
)
.
Exactly as before we get that ∂F
∂w (0,0) is an isomorphism, so by the implicit function
theorem there exist δ >0 and an analytic function wj (t) deﬁned on |t− t0| < δ
such that F(t,wj (t)) = 0. In addition, we obtain for each |t− t0| < δa linearly
independent set of functions {ϕj (t)}m
j=1, given by ϕj (t) = φj + wj (t), that satisfy
the equation (6 .6). By using the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process with
respect to the inner product
(u,v) :=
∫
M
uvdmt,
14 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
we can without loss of generality assume that {ϕj (t)}m
j=1 is orthonormal. Note that
the functions ϕj (t) belong to Dt = {u∈ H2(M,dm0),Tt(νt,∇u) = 0 }. Moreover,
since Lt is self-adjoint with respect to the inner product deﬁned above, it f ollows
that the matrix
∫
M ϕj Ltϕkdmt is symmetric.
For a given T ∈ S 2,k, we deﬁne a family of Riemannian metrics on M by
g(t) = g0 + tT and let P(t) be given by
P(t)u=
m∑
j=1
ϕj (t)
∫
M
uϕj (t)dmt.
We ﬁnally deﬁne for each j = 1 ,...,m ,
Gj : ( −ǫ,ǫ) × R × H2(M) − → [φj ]⊥ × H
2 (M,dm0) × R(P)
(t,λ,w ) ↦→
(
Gj1(t,λ,w ),Gj2(t,λ,w ),Gj3(t,λ,w )
)
by 


Gj1 = ( I− P(t))((Lt + λ))(w+ ϕj (t))
Gj2 = Tt(νt,∇w);
Gj3 = P(t)w.
Once again, the implicit function theorem yields a number δ >0 and functions
wj (t,λ) such that for any |t − t0| < δ and every |λ − λ0| < δ, the equality
Gj (t,λ,w j (t,λ)) = (0 ,0,0) holds. As we know, λ is an eigenvalue for (6.1) if
and only if there exists a nonzero m-uple c= ( c1,...,c m) of real numbers such that
A(t,λ)c= 0, where
Aij (t,λ) =
∫
M
ϕi(t)(Lt + λ)(ϕj (t) + wj (t,λ))dmt.
That is, λ is an eigenvalue of (6.1) if det A(t,λ) = 0. By Rouch´ e's theorem, there
exist m roots near λ0 counting multiplicity, for each t. So by Puiseux's theo-
rem [ 22] there exist m-analytic functions t → λi(t) which locally solve the equa-
tion det A(t,λ) = 0. It can be easily seen that A is symmetric and hence, by
Kato's Selection theorem [ 14], we can ﬁnd an analytic curve ci(t) ∈ Rm such that
A(t,λi(t))ci(t) = 0, for each i= 1 ,...,m . Thus
ψi(t) =
m∑
j=1
ci
j (t)(ϕj + ωj (t,λi(t)))
is an analytic curve of eigenfunctions for (6.1) associated with λi(t). Reasoning
exactly as Kato in [ 14, p. 98] we can obtain m-analytic curves of eigenvalues
{φi(t)}m
i=1 such that
∫
M φi(t)φj (t)dmt = δj
i .
□
Remark 1. In the case of m = m(λ0) = 1 , the existence of a diﬀerentiable
curve of eigenvalues through λ0 follows directly from the implicit function theorem
applied to the map F : Sk × H2(M,dm0) × R → L2(M,dm0) × R deﬁned by
F(g,u,λ ) =
(
(Lg + λ)u,
∫
M

)
.
The corresponding formula to the derivative λ′(t) can be obtained by letting i= j =
1 in Proposition 3.

Remark 2. We observe that Theorem 1 remains valid if we replace the Diri ch-
let boundary condition by the Tg-Neumann boundary condition.
7. Domain variation
In this section we consider the case of domain deformation. For this , let ( M,g)
be a Riemannian manifold, Ω ⊂ M be a bounded domain with smooth boundary
∂Ω, and T be a symmetric (0 ,2)-tensor on M. We consider a deformation Ω t by
the family of diﬀeomorphisms ft : Ω → Ω t, where f0 = idΩ is the identity map.
The smooth variations of g and T are given by
g(t) = f∗

The next two technical lemmas are necessary tools to obtain the Ha damard-
types formulas given by Proposition 7.
Lemma 3. For X,Y ∈ X(M), we have
HT (X,Y ) = −⟨∇T X V,Y ⟩ − ⟨X,∇T Y V⟩+ ⟨(∇V T)X,Y ⟩. (7.1)
Proof.
T′(X,Y ) = ( LV T)(X,Y )
= V⟨TX,Y ⟩ − T(∇V X− ∇X V,Y ) − T(X,∇V Y − ∇Y V)
= T(X,∇Y V) + T(∇X V,Y ) + ⟨∇V (TX),Y ⟩ − T(∇V X,Y )
= T(X,∇Y V) + T(∇X V,Y ) + ⟨(∇V T)X,Y ⟩.
In particular, for T = g, we get
H(X,Y ) = ⟨∇X V,Y ⟩+ ⟨X,∇Y V⟩.
Follows that
HT(X,Y ) = H(TX,Y ) = ⟨∇T X V,Y ⟩+ ⟨TX, ∇Y V⟩
and
TH(X,Y ) = H(X,TY ) = ⟨∇X V,TY ⟩+ ⟨X,∇T Y V⟩.
By using the identity HT = T′ − (HT + TH) we conclude our proof. □
Lemma 4. For any eigenfunctions associated to the eigenvalue λ we have
HT (∇φi,∇φj ) = −divη(⟨V,∇φj ⟩T∇φi +⟨V,∇φi⟩T∇φj )+ 1
2 ⟨V,∇L (φiφj )⟩. (7.2)
Proof. Equation (7.1) implies
HT (∇φi,∇φj ) = − ⟨∇T ∇φi V,∇φj ⟩ − ⟨∇T ∇φj V,∇φi⟩+ ⟨(∇V T)∇φi,∇φj ⟩.
Now, we observe that
⟨∇T ∇φi V,∇φj ⟩ = div η(⟨V,∇φj ⟩T∇φi) + λ⟨V,∇φj ⟩φi − ∇2φj (V,T ∇φi).
Moreover,
∇2φj (V,T ∇φi) + ∇2φi(V,T ∇φj ) + ⟨(∇V T)∇φi,∇φj ⟩ = ⟨∇(T(∇φi,∇φj )),V ⟩.
16 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
Thus,
HT (∇φi,∇φj ) = − divη(⟨V,∇φj ⟩T∇φi + ⟨V,∇φi⟩T∇φj ) − λ⟨V,∇(φj φi)⟩+
+ ⟨∇(T(∇φi,∇φj )),V ⟩
= −divη(⟨V,∇φj ⟩T∇φi + ⟨V,∇φi⟩T∇φj ) + 1
2⟨V,∇L (φiφj )⟩.
It ﬁnishes the proof. □
The next proposition provides Hadamard-type formulas for the eig envalues of
the operator L considering both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
Proposition 6. Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold, Ω ⊂ M be a bounded
domain, ft : Ω → (M,g) be an analytic family of diﬀeomorphisms (Ω t = ft(Ω)) and
λ be an eigenvalue of Lg with multiplicity m >1. Then there exist a family of m
functions {φi(t)} ∈ C∞(Ω t) with ⟨φi(t),φj (t)⟩L2(Ω t,dm) = δij and a diﬀerentiable
family of real numbers λi(t) with λi(0) = λ, such that they satisfy
{
−Ltφi(t) = λ(t)φi(t) in Ω
Bα(φi(t)) = 0 on ∂Ω , (7.3)
for all t and i= 1 ,...,m , where Bα(φi) = α⟨T∇φi,νt⟩+ (1 − α)φi for α∈ { 0,1}.
Moreover, we obtain the following variation formula

Remark 3. We point out that if T = id and η is constant, then formula (7.4)
has been obtained by Souﬁ and Ilias [20], moreover, Henry [12] also gave a similar
formula for the Laplacian on domains in Rn.
Proof. Consider the family of metrics g(t) = f∗
t gand symmetric (0 ,2)-tensors
Tt = f∗
t T on Ω. It is not diﬃcult to see that Lemma 2 is still valid for the operator
¯Lt with η(t) = η◦ ft, that is, there exists a family { ¯φi(t)} ⊂ C∞(Ω) of analytic
functions in t satisfying ⟨¯φi(t),¯φj (t)⟩L2(Ω ,dmt) = δij and
− ¯Lt ¯φi(t) = λi(t) ¯φi(t) in Ω . (7.5)
We claim that λi(t) and φi(t) := ¯φi(t) ◦ f−1
t satisfy (7.3). Initially, we have
g(df(TtX),dfei) = gt(TtX,ei) = Tt(X,ei) = T(dfX,dfei) = g(TdfX,dfei),
for all X ∈ X(M). So dfTt∇t ¯φ= T∇φ and

Proposition 6 under the boundary conditions becomes
Proposition 7. Let ft,λ(t),φi(t) be as in Proposition 6, and let us consider
the eigenvalue boundary problem
{ −Ltφi(t) = λ(t)φi(t) in Ω
Bα(φi(t)) = 0 on ∂Ω . (7.6)

Proof. It is enough to use (7.4) together with the identities

It is known that the set Diﬀ r(Ω) of Cr-diﬀeomorphisms of Ω is an aﬃne sub-
manifold of a Banach Space [ 8]. The result below shows that the multiplicity of an
eigenvalue can be reduced by small perturbation of the domain.
18 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
Theorem 2. Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold and let Ω ⊂ M be a bounded
domain. If λ is an eigenvalue with multiplicity m> 1 of the problem{
−Lgφ = λφ in Ω
Bαφ = 0 on ∂Ω , (7.9)
where Bα(φi) = α⟨T∇φi,νt⟩+ (1 − α)φi for α∈ { 0,1}, then in every neighborhood
of the identity idΩ with respect to the Cr topology, there exist a diﬀeomorphism f
and a positive ǫsuch that |λ(f)−λ(idΩ )| <ǫ, and λ(f) is simple. In particular, the
subset of diﬀeomorphisms D ⊂ Diﬀ r(Ω) that make the eigenvalues of (7.9) simple,
is residual.
Proof. Let λbe an eigenvalue of multiplicity m> 1 and suppose that, for all
perturbation by diﬀeomorphism of Ω, the multiplicity of λcannot be reduced. The
proceeding follows the same lines as in proof of Theorem 1.
For α= 0 case, from (7.7) we have ∂φi
∂ν
∂φj
∂ν = 0 on ∂Ω. This way either ∂φi
∂ν = 0
or ∂φj
∂ν = 0 in some open set U of ∂Ω. If ∂φi
∂ν = 0 in U, since φi = 0 on ∂Ω, it
follows from the unique continuation principle [ 13] that φi = 0 on Ω, which is a
contradiction.
For α= 1 case. From (7.8) we have
T(∇φi,∇φj ) − λφiφj = 0
on ∂Ω. By the Uhlenbeck's argument once again we get a contradiction. I t proves
the ﬁrst part of the theorem. The second part follows from the an alogous argument
as in the proof of Theorem 1. □
8. Application to extremal domains for the kth-eigenvalue
Before to claim the main results of this section we will begin with some de ﬁ-
nitions and remarks. Here, we will consider only analytic volume-pres erving defor-
mation of Ω ⊂ M. Let µk(t) be the kth-eigenvalue of Lt with Dirichlet boundary
condition.
If Ω t = ft(Ω) is an analytic volume-preserving deformation of Ω, then it is not
diﬃcult to see that v:=
⟨ d

ft,ν

must satisfy
∫
∂Ω vdµ= 0. We denote A0(∂Ω)
the set of all regular functions on ∂Ω such that
∫
∂Ω vdµ= 0. Souﬁ and Ilias proved
that given a v ∈ A 0(∂Ω) there exists an analytic volume-preserving deformation
Ω t = ft(Ω) such that v:=
⟨ d

⏐
⏐
⏐
t=0
ft,ν

∈ A 0(∂Ω) (see [ 20]). Recall that a domain
Ω ⊂ M is a local minimizer (local maximizer) for the kth-eigenvalue µk of L if for
any analytic volume-preserving deformation Ω t, the function t ↦→µk(t) admits a
local minimum (local maximum) at t= 0.
Theorem 3. Let k be a positive integer such that the kth-eigenvalue µk of
L φ = div η(T∇φ) with Dirichlet boundary condition satisﬁes µk > µk−1 (resp.
µk < µk+1). If Ω is a local minimizer (resp. local maximizer) for µk, then, it is
simple and for some constant c its associated eigenfuction φ satisﬁes⏐

ON EIGENV ALUES OF A CLASS OF SECOND ORDER ELLIPTIC OPERATORS 19
{φi(t)} be analytic families of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions given by Lemma 2
such that λi(0) = µk. By continuity λi(t) > µk−1(t) for suﬃciently small t, since
λi(0) = µk >µk−1. By hypothesis, the function t↦→µk(t) admits a local minimum
at t= 0. So, λi(t) also admits a local minimum at t= 0 and then d

eigenvalue µk. Hence, ∂φ
∂ν
√
T(ν,ν) is locally constant on ∂Ω for any φ ∈ Ek.
Let φ1 and φ2 be two eigenfunctions in Ek, one can ﬁnd a linear combination
αφ1 + βφ2 =: φ so that ∂φ
∂ν vanishes, at least, on one connected component of Ω.
To this end, it is suﬃcient to choose α and β such that

Applying the principle of the unique continuation [ 13], we deduce that φ is identi-
cally zero and that µk is simple. To complete the proof, we must show that, for all
φ∈ Ek, ( ∂φ

) 2
T(ν,ν)
takes the same constant value on all the connected components o f ∂Ω. For it, let
Σ 1 and Σ 2 be two distinct connected components of ∂Ω and let v∈ A 0(∂Ω) be the
function given by v= vol(Σ 2) on Σ 1, v= −vol(Σ 1) on Σ 2 and v= 0 on the others
components. Then the condition

9. Applications to Ricci ﬂow on closed manifold
In this section, we study some properties of the eigenvalues of Lg(t) along the
Ricci ﬂow equation
d
dtg(t) = −2Ricg(t)
on an ( n ≥ 3)-dimensional closed smooth manifold Mn, where Ricg(t) stands for
the Ricci curvature of the Riemannian manifold ( M,g(t)).
Hamilton [ 11] established the existence and the uniqueness of solutions to the
Ricci ﬂow equation in a maximal interval [0 ,δ), δ ≤ +∞, for any given initial
Riemannian metric g0 = g(0). This maximal solution is then called the Ricci ﬂow
with initial condition g0, and δ (whenever ﬁnite) is called the blow-up time of the
ﬂow.
We start by observing that the eigenvalues of Lg(t)(·) = div η(Tg(t)∇(·)) can
be parametrized C2-diﬀerentiable in t, see Theorem ( C) in [ 15]. Now, we derive a
general evolution formula for the eigenvalues of Lg(t) along the Ricci ﬂow.
20 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
Proposition 8. If λ(t) denotes the evolution of an eigenvalue of Lg(t) along
the Ricci ﬂow on Mn, then
λ′ =
∫
M
R(λu2 − T(∇u,∇u))dm +
∫
M
[
4Ric(T∇u,∇u) + T′(∇u,∇u)
]
dm, (9.1)
where u stands for an eigenfunction associated to the eigenvalue λ, and R is the
scalar curvature.
Proof. Taking H = −2Ricg(t) we get
TH(∇u,∇u) = HT(∇u,∇u) = −2Ric(T∇u,∇u).
Thus, by deﬁnition of HT we have
HT (∇u,∇u) = 4 Ric(T∇u,∇u) + T′(∇u,∇u).
Since h= −2Rand L u2 = 2 uL u+ 2T(∇u,∇u), we obtain from (4.2)
λ′(t) =
∫
M
h
4 L u2 + HT (∇u,∇u)dm
=
∫
M
R(λu2 − T(∇u,∇u))dm +
∫
M
4Ric(T∇u,∇u) + T′(∇u,∇u)dm,
which is (9.1). □
Let us now consider the behavior of the spectrum when we evolve an initial
metric that is homogeneous. Hamilton showed that the Ricci ﬂow pre serves the
isometries of the initial Riemannian manifold. Hence, the evolving metr ic remains
homogeneous along the ﬂow. This important observation implies the f ollowing:
Theorem 4. Let λ(t) be the evolution of an eigenvalue of Lg(t) along the Ricci
ﬂow on a closed homogeneous Riemannian manifold Mn. If T′ ≥ − 4Ric(T,·), then
λ(t) is non-decreasing along the ﬂow.
Proof. Since the evolving metric remains homogeneous along the ﬂow, we
have that R is constant for all time. So, from equation (2.1) and Proposition 8 we
deduce that
λ′ =
∫
M
4Ric(T∇u,∇u) + T′(∇u,∇u)dm
and the result follows from the assumption that T′ ≥ − 4Ric(T,·). □
Example 1. Let g(t) be a solution to the Ricci ﬂow on a closed homogeneous
Riemannian manifold Mn such that the initial Riemannian metric has strictly pos-
itive Ricci curvature and it continues so for all time. Consi der Tt = ψg(t), for
some positive smooth function ψ on Mn. Then, T′ > −4Ric(T,·) and hence the
eigenvalue λ(t) of divη(ψ∇(·)) is non-decreasing along the ﬂow.
For a three-dimensional closed smooth manifold, Hamilton also prove d that if
the initial Riemannian metric has strictly positive Ricci curvature, th en it continues
so for all time.
Theorem 5. Let g(t) be a solution to the Ricci ﬂow on a three-dimensional
closed Riemannian manifold M3 with initial Ricci curvature that is strictly positive.
Then, there exist t0 ∈ [0,δ) such that the eigenvalue λ(t) of divη(ψ∇(·)) increase
for t∈ [t0,δ).
ON EIGENV ALUES OF A CLASS OF SECOND ORDER ELLIPTIC OPERATORS 21
Proof. Let g(t) be a solution to the Ricci ﬂow on a closed three-manifold M
with strictly positive initial Ricci curvature, then R >0 and there is ε >0 such
that Ric ≥ εRg, and we can assume 2 ε− 1 ≤ 0. So both conditions remain valid
on 0 ≤ t<δ (see [ 11, Theorem 9.4]), and then by (9.1)
λ′(t) = λ

By Theorem 15.1 in [ 11], we have Rmax(t)
Rmin(t) → 1 as t → δ. Then there is t0 ≥ 0 so
that
−(2ε− 1) < Rmin(t)
Rmax(t) ≤ 1 ∀t0 ≤ t<δ,
from which we get λ′(t) >0 for all t∈ [t0,δ), which proves our theorem. □
Let L u = div η(∇u) be the drifted Laplacian and Ricη := Ric+ ∇2η be the
Bakry-´Emery-Ricci tensor. From the classical Bochner's formula, we obt ain
2L|∇u|2 = Ricη(∇u,∇u) + ⟨∇(Lu),∇u⟩+ |∇2u|2. (9.2)
Besides, it is true that
⟨∇ψ,∇|∇u|2⟩ = 2 ⟨∇∇u∇u,∇ψ⟩ = 2( ∇u)⟨∇ψ,∇u⟩ − 2∇2ψ(∇u,∇u),
for any smooth function ψ on M. So,
ψL|∇u|2 = L |∇u|2 − ⟨∇ψ,∇|∇u|2⟩
= L |∇u|2 − 2(∇u)⟨∇ψ,∇u⟩+ 2∇2ψ(∇u,∇u). (9.3)
But,
(∇u)⟨∇ψ,∇u⟩ = ⟨∇u,∇⟨∇u,∇ψ⟩⟩
= ⟨∇u,∇(L u)⟩ − ⟨∇u,∇(ψLu)⟩
= div η(L u∇u) − (L u)Lu− divη
(
ψLu∇u
)
+ ψ(Lu)2 (9.4)
and
ψ⟨∇(Lu),∇u⟩ = div η
(
ψLu∇u
)
− (L u)Lu. (9.5)
Joining (9.2), (9.3), (9.4) and (9.4), we get the Bochner type formu la for the oper-
ator L u= div η(ψ∇u) as follows
2L |∇u|2 = div η(L u∇u) + ψRicη(∇u,∇u) − 2(L u)Lu+ ψ(Lu)2
+ψ|∇2u|2 − ∇2ψ(∇u,∇u). (9.6)
This formula will be useful in the proof of our next result.
Remark 4. Alencar, Neto and Zhou [1] showed a Bochner type formula for the
operator that has been introduced by Cheng and Yau [7]. The Bochner type formula
for the more general expression of L has been proved by Gomes and Miranda [9].
We know that in the hypothesis of Theorem 5 the solution to the Ricci ﬂow
becomes extinct in ﬁnite time, in particular, lim
t→δ
Rmin(t) = ∞.
22 C. L. CUNHA 1, J. N. GOMES 2 AND M. A. M. MARROCOS 3
Theorem 6. Let g(t) be the solution to the Ricci ﬂow on a three-dimensional
closed Riemannian manifold M3 with strictly positive initial Ricci curvature and
λ(t) the evolution of an eigenvalue of divη(ψ∇(·)), with ψ ≥ c for some constant
c> 0. If ∇2ψ≤ 0, then
lim
t→δ
λ(t) = ∞.
Proof. Integrating (9.6) gives

We already know that for any solution of the Ricci ﬂow on a closed thr ee-
manifold with positive Ricci curvature, there exists ǫ >0 such that Ric ≥ ǫRg is
preserved along the ﬂow. Thus
2λ2c−1 −
∫
M
ψ∇2η(∇u,∇u)dm ≥ ǫ
∫
M
Rψ|∇u|2dm ≥ ǫRminλ.
Now, note that ∇2η(∇u,∇u) ≥ d|∇u|2, for some constant d(t) >0, and then
λ(t) ≥ c(ǫRmin(t) + d(t))/2.
Since
lim
t→δ
Rmin(t) = ∞,
the proof is complete. □
