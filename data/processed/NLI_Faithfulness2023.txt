Deep machine learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been suc-
cessful in the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using medical images, questionnaires,
and videos. This paper proposes a novel Multi-branch Classifier-Video Vision Transformer (MC-
ViViT) model to distinguish MCI from those with normal cognition by analyzing facial features.
The data comes from the I-CONECT, a behavioral intervention trial aimed at improving cognitive
function by providing frequent video chats. MC-ViViT extracts spatiotemporal features of videos in
one branch and augments representations by the MC module. The I-CONECT dataset is challenging
as the dataset is imbalanced containing Hard-Easy and Positive-Negative samples, which impedes the
performance of MC-ViViT. We propose a loss function for Hard-Easy and Positive-Negative Samples
(HP Loss) by combining Focal loss and AD-CORRE loss to address the imbalanced problem. Our
experimental results on the I-CONECT dataset show the great potential of MC-ViViT in predicting
MCI with a high accuracy of 90.63% accuracy on some of the interview videos.
1. Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD)
are national public health issues with pervasive challenges
for older adults, their families, and caregivers. ADRD is
not only ranked as the sixth-leading cause of death in the
U.S., but the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number
of deaths among those with AD (Alzheimer's_Association,
2021). Symptoms of AD/ADRD usually begin with Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and include early onset mem-
ory loss, cognitive decline, and impairments with verbal
language and visual/spatial perception. Approximately 12-
18% of people age 60 or older are living with MCI in the
U.S. Although older adults with MCI have the ability to
independently perform most daily living activities such as
eating, shopping, and bathing without help, the National
Institute on Aging (NIA) estimated that 10 to 20% of
subjects with MCI will develop dementia over a one-year
period (National_Institute_on_Aging, 2021).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) & Positron Emis-
sion Tomography (PET) scanning and neuropsychic exam-
ination are often used for identifying those with AD and
dementia. These methods prove to be challenging for early
MCI individuals given that the brain's structural changes

and cognitive test results at this point might be harder to
differentiate from those with normal cognitive aging and
the invasive nature of these assessments (Tang et al., 2020).
Using accurate, non-invasive, and cost-efficient diagnostic
technology has the potential to bolster the early detection of
MCI and AD. A 2019 study proposed that early detection of
AD would decrease healthcare costs, and improve quality of
life (Eikelboom et al., 2019). Studies have shown that MCI
can affect the patterns of speech, language, and face-to-face
communication in older adults (Liu et al., 2022a). There
are several studies on using traditional Machine Learn-
ing (ML) approaches such as Decision Tree (Neelaveni
& Devasana, 2020; Davuluri1 & Rengaswamy, 2020) and
K-means clustering (Davuluri1 & Rengaswamy, 2020) to
detect AD with a human using collected demographic in-
formation (Neelaveni & Devasana, 2020) and MRI (Davu-
luri1 & Rengaswamy, 2020). Other researchers used Cross-
model Augmentation for automated detection of MCI from
normal cognition (NC) using speech and language pat-
terns (Liu et al., 2022a). However, there is fewer work on
using ML models and particularly Deep Learning models
for facial video analysis and then automated detection of
MCI using visual features. This paper presents our recent
work on developing and using Transformer-based models
for the detection of MCI using facial videos collected in the
Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial
(I-CONECT) Study project 1 (Carr, 2019; Yu et al., 2021;
Wu et al., 2022) (Clinicaltrials.gov #: NCT02871921). I-
CONECT Study is a randomized controlled behavioral
intervention trial aimed to enhance cognitive functions by
providing frequent social interactions using video chats.

MC-ViViT: Multi-branch Classifier-ViViT to Detect Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults Using Facial Videos
Figure 1:The structure of the proposed MC-ViViT. D is the model depth. It represents the layer number of MC-ViViT, which is
the total number of Spatial Transformers and Temporal Transformers. Layer Norm is Layer Normalization.
MC-ViViT takes tubelet embedding to divide the video clips into cubes and loads these cubes into Transformer Encoder
sequentially. Then, Transformer Encoder takes Factorised Encoder to extract spatio-temporal features. Finally, the output
features go into Multi-branch Classifier to finish classification.
were provided 4 times per week for 6 months to older adults.
The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging
(NIA).
Facial videos contain spatial features like facial expres-
sions and head poses. It can also capture facial expression
change, track eye gaze motion, head pose movement, and
lips activity, which are the temporal features and the key
patterns in verbal and non-verbal communication (Tanaka
et al., 2019; Nam et al., 2020). We hypothesize that facial
videos collected during face-to-face communication in so-
cial settings can provide rich information for the detection
of MCI from NC subjects. To capture facial features out
of facial videos, we develop a variant of the Video Vision
Transformer-based model (ViViT (Arnab et al., 2021)).
This model takes Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy
et al., 2020) as its backbone and captures spatio-temporal
features. ViViT has proven its value on Facial Expression
Recognition (FER) (Huang et al., 2021) and violence detec-
tion (Singh et al., 2022).
The I-CONECT dataset has both inter- and intra-class
variations, which makes it a challenging video dataset. First,
it is an imbalanced dataset as the distributions of MCI and
NC subjects are uneven. This makes the dataset inter-class
imbalance (aka Hard-Easy sample problem). The intra-
class imbalanced issue happens within each class as the I-
CONECT dataset consists of videos in different lengths.
Also, the quality of the videos in I-CONECT may vary from
subject to subject. The occlusion and lightness problems in
the videos decrease the quality of extracted spatio-temporal
features. Furthermore, some subjects may not behave any
symptoms of MCI, and act like NC in some video clips,
which restricts ViViT from extracting enough MCI-related
features. This is the so-called Positive-Negative sample
problem.
To address these problems, we propose a Multi-branch
Classifier (MC) module to augment the representation ca-
pability of ViViT. The proposed MC has four levels of
Fully Connected (FC) layers, whereas the third one has 4
branches. MC provides more features but gives all features
identical weight. Purely depending on MC contributes lim-
itedly to the accuracy. We decide to assign different weights
to features and classes while computing loss. Subsequently,
we combined Focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) and AD-CORRE
loss (Fard & Mahoor, 2022) into the loss function for Hard-
Easy and Positive-Negative Samples (HP loss) to relief the
negative effect of inter- and intra-class imbalanced issues.
Specifically, the Focal Loss is responsible for the Hard-Easy
sample problem, while AD-CORRE loss (Fard & Mahoor,
2022) handles the Positive-Negative sample problem.
In summary, we present a new model called Multi-
branch Classifier-ViViT (MC-ViViT), by integrating the
aforementioned ViViT, MC, and HP Loss. We validated
MC-ViViT on several themes of the I-CONECT dataset.
Our experimental results show that MC-ViViT is highly
capable to detect MCI from NC subjects.
The overall contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose MC-ViViT to detect MCI from the inter-
view videos provided by the I-CONECT Study.
• We design the MC module to enrich the extracted
spatio-temporal features. Its multi-branch structure
helps ViViT to capture the visual features from dif-
ferent perspectives.
• We develop the HP loss by combining Focal loss and
AD-CORRE loss. The HP loss addresses the inter-
and intra-class imbalanced issues and helps the model
pay attention to classes with less samples and subjects
with short video lengths.

suggestions for future research in Section 5.
2. Related Work
2.1. Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI) Using Machine Learning Methods
Detection of MCI in older adults using innovative ma-
chine learning approaches has received great attention in the
research community (Cavedoni et al., 2020). It is known
that cognitive impairment and dementia adversely affect
people's verbal and nonverbal behaviors, memory, cogni-
tive functions, etc. Since the focus of this paper is on
the detection of MCI using nonverbal visual patterns and
behaviors expressed in facial videos of older adults using
deep machine learning methods, we review the literature
on using ML methods for the detection of MCI. Some
researchers have utilized traditional ML approaches to de-
tect MCI or more advanced stages of cognitive impairment
such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. ML methods
such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees,
PCA+SVM, K-means cluster, hierarchical clustering, and
Density-based spatial clusters of applications with noise
(DBSCAN) (Asim et al., 2018; Neelaveni & Devasana,
2020; Davuluri1 & Rengaswamy, 2020; Pang et al., 2023;
de Mendonça et al., 2023) are the most common algorithms
used in this domain.
Some researchers have exploited deep learning models
to detect MCI and dementia, such as CNN models with In-
ception modules (Ding et al., 2019), linking a fully convolu-
tional network (FCN) to a traditional multilayer perceptron
(MLP) (Qiu et al., 2020), Inception-ResNet-V2 (Lu et al.,
2021), and CNN-based models (Salehi et al., 2020; Poloni
et al., 2022; De & Chowdhury, 2021; de Mendonça et al.,
2023).
Researchers have proposed that cognitive impairment
and AD causes severe face recognition deficits and emotion
detection deficits (Sapey-Triomphe et al., 2015; Martinez
et al., 2018; Torres Mendonça De Melo Fádel et al., 2019;
Dourado et al., 2019; Mazzi et al., 2020; Meléndez et al.,
2020; Gil & Arroyo-Anlló, 2021). They collected the re-
action of participants to specific emotions to estimate the
degree of recognition deficits, which is a kind of MCI.
The aforementioned work did experiments on either
brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, CT scans,
and X-ray Scans (Islam & Zhang, 2018; Asim et al., 2018;
Ding et al., 2019; Davuluri1 & Rengaswamy, 2020; Salehi
et al., 2020; Mazzi et al., 2020; Rehouma et al., 2021;
Mercioni & Stavarache, 2022; Lu et al., 2021; Poloni et al.,
2022; De & Chowdhury, 2021; de Mendonça et al., 2023) or
demographic information, patient interviews, and structured
datasets that are available on line (Sapey-Triomphe et al.,
2015; Asim et al., 2018; Martinez et al., 2018; Torres
Mendonça De Melo Fádel et al., 2019; Dourado et al., 2019;
Neelaveni & Devasana, 2020; Davuluri1 & Rengaswamy,
2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Mazzi et al., 2020; Gil & Arroyo-
Anlló, 2021; Hammoudeh et al., 2022; Pang et al., 2023).
Collecting brain MRI and CT Scans are expensive. Other
data modalities such as demographic information, patient
interviews, and online structured datasets contain less com-
plex, subtle, and subjective features. On the other hand,
audiovisual collected during social interviews and face-to-
face communication either in person or virtually contain
rich verbal and nonverbal information.
Some researchers (Nam et al., 2020) video recorded
the reaction of participants to different commands and
introduced eye gaze and head pose in their study. Jiang et al.
(2022) indicated the influence of eye-tracking on predicting
cognitive impairment too. Tanaka et al. (2019) filmed the
video during the human-agent interaction and considered
action units, eye gaze, and lip activity in the study. It
asked three fixed queries: Q1) What's the date today?, Q2)
Tell me something interesting about yourself, Q3) How did
you come here today? Then, Fei et al. (2019) argued that
extracting facial features in dynamic approaches benefits
analyzing the evolution of facial expressions and getting
spatio-temporal features. It also showed different facial
feature extraction techniques, such as Geometric, Appear-
ance, Holistic, and Local. Finally, Umeda-Kameyama et al.
(2021) explored the capability of Xception and other CNN-
based models to distinguish between people with cognitive
impairment and those without dementia. Intuitively, our
work explores the feasibility of an advanced deep learning
model to predict MCI on the I-CONECT dataset.
2.2. Facial Video Analysis Using Deep Neural
Models
Automated analysis of facial videos using deep ma-
chine learning and computer vision has been studied in the
last decades. The applications vary from facial expression
recognition (FER) (Jin et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a;
Khan et al., 2017), surveillance (Patrikar & Parate, 2022;
Ling et al., 2021; Song et al., 2022), pose estimation (Liu
et al., 2022c; Sümer et al., 2021), head gesture recog-
nition (Khan et al., 2022; Gashi et al., 2021; Li et al.,
2022; Xia et al., 2022), medical applications (Sonawane &
Sharma, 2021; Sibley et al., 2021; Villa et al., 2021), among
others. This section presents related works that used deep
neural network-based algorithms for facial video analysis.
When it comes to FER, some works used the traditional
technique of converting videos into frames. For example,
Liu et al. (2021b) compressed videos into an apex frame
by the encoding algorithm. Jin et al. (2020) simply cut
J.Sun et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 3 of 13
MC-ViViT: Multi-branch Classifier-ViViT to Detect Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults Using Facial Videos
videos into images, but it enriched features by using facial
landmark points. Loading videos directly is another method.
FER-GCN (Liu et al., 2021a), TimeSformer (Mohan &
Popa, 2021), and three-stream network (Kim et al., 2022)
simulated to analyze the video directly by taking multi
frames as input. They stated that a sequence-based model
helps extract temporal features. Based on multi frames,
some researchers implemented a multi-frame optical flow
method to get the difference between two frames (Pan et al.,
2020; Liang et al., 2021). They claimed that multi-frame
optical flow enriched temporal features. The aforemen-
tioned studies defended their idea with good experimental
results. Furthermore, Jin et al. (2020) focused on diagnosing
Parkinson's Disease (PD), which inspires us to believe that
Deep Learning-based models are able to detect MCI.
Using more deep neural methods, Transformer-based
models utilize modules to help capture spatio-temporal
features in one stream, such as Convolutional Spatiotem-
poral Encoding layer from TimeConvNets (Hou Lee &
Wong, 2020) and Temporal Shift Module (TSM) from
TimeSformer (Mohan & Popa, 2021) and ViViT-B/16×2
FE (Arnab et al., 2021) (A ViT-Base backbone with a tubelet
size of ℎ ×𝑤 ×𝑡 = 16 × 16 × 2, FE represents factor-
ized encoder). Other works utilized spatial-only attention
and temporal-only attention consecutively to extract spatio-
temporal features in one branch (Mohan & Popa, 2021;
Bulat et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022d).
On the other hand, CNN-based models usually take
multi-stream structure to extract spatio-temporal features
separately, such as deep temporal-spatial networks (Pan
et al., 2020), TMSAU-Net (Liang et al., 2021), and three-
stream network (Kim et al., 2022). These models take
optical flow, frame difference, and motion vector methods
to help create temporal information instead of learning from
the raw images through the model. Models with 3D Convo-
lutional operation can extract spatio-temporal information
in one stream, but their large hyperparameter scale improves
computational complexity.
Comprehensively, to avoid the extra operation and im-
plement the model thoroughly and efficiently, this research
selected ViViT FE as the backbone of the proposed model.
2.3. Feature Enrichment using MLP Head
Inception Net (Szegedy et al., 2015) is a classic CNN
model. It consists of repeated Inception Modules, which ap-
ply various scaled filters to extract features on the same layer
and broaden the network. The advantage of the Inception
Module is to enrich the features. Multi-models also help
augment representation and improve accuracy. Moreover,
some researchers have shown the effect of multi-models
on MCI detection (Zhang et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019;
Liu et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2021; Naz et al., 2022). In
addition, a good Fully Connected layer benefits the model
performance, such as XnODR and XnIDR (Sun et al., 2021).
The Inception Net and multi-models inspired the design of
the Multi-branch Classifier (MC) (see Section 3.3).
2.4. Inter-class and Intra-class Imbalanced
Problems
Inter-class and intra-class imbalanced problems usually
prevent ML models from predicting well. In (He et al.,
2019) the authors explained that the inter-class imbalanced
problem occurs when the number of samples in some classes
is much larger than those in other classes, which causes
the misclassification of rare class examples. The intra-class
imbalanced dataset means that a class consists of several
sub-concepts or sub-clusters. Moreover, at least one of
the concepts or clusters is represented by a significantly
less number of samples than the others (He et al., 2019).
The number of features from each sub-concept are un-
equal, which weakens the performance of classifier (Sam-
path et al., 2021).
Focal Loss is powerful to equalize inter-class imbal-
anced datasets (Lin et al., 2017). Moreover, classes with
more features are easier to detect than those with less
features. This is also called the Hard-Easy sample problem.
To address the intra-class imbalanced issue, researchers
have proposed methods such as feature selection (He et al.,
2019), resampling (He et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021c), and
designing loss function (Farzaneh & Qi, 2020; Ngo & Yoon,
2020; Farzaneh & Qi, 2021; Fard & Mahoor, 2022). For
example, EPIMTS (early prediction on the imbalanced mul-
tivariate time series) fused feature selection and resampling,
which calls MUDSG to resample based on the extracted
core shapelets (He et al., 2019). Liu et al. (2021c) uti-
lized Soft Hard Example Mining (SHEM) to re-balance
the error density distribution. To achieve intra-class bal-
ancing, they assigned instance-wise sampling probabilities
according to the prediction of the current ensemble model
𝐹𝑡−1(⋅)(Liu et al., 2021c). Other works focus on upgrading
loss function. They proposed Discriminant Distribution-
Agnostic loss (DDA loss) (Farzaneh & Qi, 2020), Weighted
Center Loss (WCL) (Ngo & Yoon, 2020), Deep Attentive
Center Loss (DACL) (Farzaneh & Qi, 2021), and Quadru-
plet loss (Tian et al., 2021). These loss functions are tightly
related to center loss. The goal of these methods is to
achieve intra-class compactness and inter-class separation.
The AD-CORRE loss presented in (Fard & Mahoor, 2022)
aims to handle inter- and intra-class imbalanced issues,
but it focuses on addressing the problem by digging the
correlation between embeddings in the mini-batch level.
Then, it embeds the influence of whole training samples into
batches incrementally instead of directly (Fard & Mahoor,
2022). This has less computational cost.
In the I-CONECT dataset, the number of samples with
MCI is apparently more than that with NC. Thus, subjects
labeled in MCI are easy samples, while those labeled in
NC are hard ones. To emphasize and increase the weight of
NC, we apply Focal Loss to address the Hard-Easy sample
problem.
Within each class, the number of frames from each video
is unequal. This is particularly important as interviewees
with MCI may behave cognitively normal sometimes or
show the symptoms of MCI in other parts of the video.
J.Sun et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 4 of 13
MC-ViViT: Multi-branch Classifier-ViViT to Detect Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults Using Facial Videos
The proportion of normal and symptom parts is imbalanced
and skewed too. This can affect the accuracy of the final
classification as we use majority voting to assign a video to
MCI or NC based on the number of classified clips.
In general, the I-CONECT dataset has one inter-class
imbalanced problem and two intra-class imbalanced prob-
lems. Based on the above discussion, we aim to achieve
both inter- and intra-class separation, which is different
from the target of the aforementioned loss functions such as
DDA (Farzaneh & Qi, 2020), WCL (Ngo & Yoon, 2020),
and DACL (Farzaneh & Qi, 2021). To avoid suboptimal
performance, after comprehensive thought, we are inclined
to use the Adaptive Correlation (AD-CORRE) loss (Fard
& Mahoor, 2022) to solve the Positive-Negative sample
problem.
3. Multi-branch Classifier-ViViT (MC-ViViT)
The proposed Multi-branch Classifier-ViViT (MC-ViViT)
is an end-to-end model, which predicts whether a video
segment in the I-CONECT dataset belongs to the MCI group
or normal cognition (NC). The backbone of the network is
ViViT FE (Arnab et al., 2021) as its Factorised Encoder
structure can extract Spatio-Temporal features efficiently.
To enrich the features and improve performance, MC-ViViT
utilizes multi branches for classification. Specifically, MC-
ViViT splits each video into several video cubes by Tubelet
Embedding. Then, it embeds the video cubes into tokens
and prepares the input tokens by concatenating class tokens
and positional embedding. Subsequently, MC-ViViT applies
the Transformer Encoder with Factorised Encoder to extract
Spatio-Temporal features from the input tokens. Finally, the
model computes the prediction score of each class using
multi-branch classifiers. The rest of this section explains the
model components in detail.
3.1. Tubelet Embedding Review
Figure 2:The structure of Tubelet Embedding.
Following the pattern of ViViT (Arnab et al., 2021), the
cubic patch is non-overlapping too. Suppose that the tensor
shape of one video clip is [𝑇,𝐻,𝑊, 3], where 𝑇 is the
frame numbers, 𝐻 and 𝑊 are the height and the width of
each frame, and 3represents the RGB channels. Then, the
tensor size of each cubic patch is [𝑡,ℎ,𝑤, 3]. 𝑡, ℎ, and 𝑤are
the size of the corresponding temporal, height, and width
dimensions. 𝑛𝑡 =⌊𝑇
𝑡 ⌋2, 𝑛ℎ =⌊𝐻
ℎ ⌋, and 𝑛𝑤 =⌊𝑊
𝑤 ⌋ denote
the token number of respective temporal, height, and width
dimensions. The Tubelet Embedding changes the input unit
from a 2D patch to a 3D cube, which contains temporal
information (see Fig. 2). Therefore, it is the foundation of
offering Spatio-Temporal information in MC-ViViT.
3.2. Factorised Encoder (FE) Review
Figure 3: The structure of FE. CLS is class token. The
green and purple capsules are positional embeddings. The
rest capsules are tubelet embedding. MC is a Multi-branch
classifier.
Fig. 1 shows that in ViViT (Arnab et al., 2021), the
Transformer Encoder takes the combined positional and
embedded cubic tokens as input, and it contains the Self-
Attention module followed by the FeedForward module.
Eq. (1) presents the details of the input tokens.
𝐳 =[𝑧𝑐𝑙𝑠,𝐄𝑥1,𝐄𝑥2,⋯,𝐄𝑥𝑛ℎ𝑛𝑤𝑛𝑡]+ 𝐩, (1)
where 𝑧𝑐𝑙𝑠 is a learnable class token, [𝑥1,𝑥2,⋯,𝑥𝑛𝑡𝑛ℎ𝑛𝑤]
is the tensor of cubic patches, 𝑥𝑖 ∈ ℝℎ×𝑤×𝑡 𝑛ℎ𝑛𝑤𝑛𝑡 is the
number of cubic patches.𝐸is the linear projection to embed
cubic patches. In addition, 𝐩 ∈ ℝ(𝑛ℎ𝑛𝑤𝑛𝑡+1)×𝑑 represents a
learnable positional embedding. 𝑑 is the dimension of the
embedded token.
Given the layer 𝑙, the Self-Attention module consists
of Layer Normalization (LN) and Multi-Head Dot-Product
Attention, while the FeedForward (FF) module includes LN
and MLP. Both modules use skip-connection to enrich fea-
tures and prevent gradient vanishing. Moreover, Arnab et al.
(2021) proposed four Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)
modules. This work selected FE because Arnab et al.
(2021) showed that ViViT FE performed the best of all four
versions. Fig. 3 shows that FE has two parts, Spatial Trans-
former Encoder ( 𝐿𝑠) and Temporal Transformer Encoder
(𝐿𝑡). Spatial Transformer Encoder extracts latent represen-
tations on the different tokens with the same temporal index.
Therefore, these latent representations are spatial features.
Then, these latent representations with different temporal
indexes come to the Temporal Transformer Encoder, which
2⌊⋅∕⋅⌋ means to get the largest integer not greater than ⋅∕⋅.
J.Sun et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 5 of 13
MC-ViViT: Multi-branch Classifier-ViViT to Detect Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults Using Facial Videos
studies the interactions between tokens from different time
steps. Thus, the Temporal Transformer Encoder can mine
temporal features. Assuming that the 𝐿𝑠 and 𝐿𝑡 repeats 𝑛𝑠𝑝
and 𝑛𝑡𝑝 times, respectively. FF processes the output of FE
and returns the Sequence-Level Spatio-Temporal feature.
The above explanation can be summarized as Eqs. 2-5.

et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2021; Naz et al., 2022), MC takes
multi-branch structure to provide different views and enrich
representation as well. Different from Inception Module
and multi-models, MC only does linear projection at each
branch instead of convolutional operation or the neural
network. In detail, MC consists of four FC layers. The
dimension change is 64→ 16→ [8,8,8,8]→ concatenate
to 32 → 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠, where 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 represents the
number of class. In our experiment, 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 is 2. When
we convert the dimension from 16 to 32, Fig. 4 shows that
we apply a multi-branch structure to convert the dimension
to 8 and repeat 4 times. Then, we concatenate them as a
32-dimensional tensor. With this structure, MC can provide
more features and view the object from different angles.
Figure 4:The structure of MC. ⊕represents concatenation.
3.4. Loss function for Hard-Easy and
Positive-Negative Samples (HP Loss)
HP Loss has two components, Focal Loss (Lin et al.,
2017) and AD-CORRE(FD) (Fard & Mahoor, 2022). AD-
CORRE(FD) is the FD (Feature Discriminator) component
of AD-CORRE Loss.
3.4.1. Focal Loss Review
Focal Loss addresses the imbalance aspect of Hard-Easy
samples by generating the weight based on sample numbers.
It derives from𝛼-balanced Cross Entropy loss. Then, adding
a modulating factor (1 −𝑝𝑚𝑐𝑖)𝛾 defined in Eq. (7) to the
cross entropy loss, with tunable focusing parameter 𝛾 >0,
makes the final Focal Loss. The above can be summarized
as Eq. (6).
𝐹𝐿(𝑝𝑚𝑐𝑖)=− 𝛼𝑚𝑐𝑖(1− 𝑝𝑚𝑐𝑖)𝛾𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑝𝑚𝑐𝑖) (6)
where 𝛼is a weighting factor. 𝛼 ∈[0,1]for class MCI and
1− 𝛼 for class NC. 𝑝𝑚𝑐𝑖 represents the probability of the
frame sequence attributing to MCI.
𝑝𝑚𝑐𝑖 =
{
𝑝 𝑖𝑓 𝑦 =𝑀𝐶𝐼
1− 𝑝 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (7)
where 𝑝is the model's predict score,𝑦is the predicted label.
3.4.2. AD-CORRE(FD) Review
AD-CORRE(FD) focuses on the correlation between
the samples within a mini-batch. This prevents the im-
balanced dataset from affecting the prediction. Therefore,
the model pays attention to the class with less samples
too. AD-CORRE(FD) comprises four key components of
AD-CORRE(FD), Variance Eraser (Beta Matrix 𝛽𝑛×𝑛), At-
tention Map Matrix ( Ω𝑛×𝑛), Harmony Matrix ( Φ𝑛×𝑛), and
Correlation Matrix (CORM). In short, AD-CORRE(FD) is
a weighted mean absolute error and is shown in Eq. (8).
𝐹𝐷 = 1

𝛽[𝑖,𝑗]Ω[𝑖,𝑗]
|Φ[𝑖,𝑗]− 𝐶𝑂𝑅𝑀𝑙[𝑖,𝑗]|,
(8)
where 𝑘is the class number, 𝑛is the size of mini-batch. The
difference between Φ𝑛×𝑛 and CORM𝑛×𝑛 is the core of the
AD-CORRE(FD) loss.
In general, AD-CORRE(FD) focuses on the correlation
between samples within the mini-batch. This prevents the
imbalanced dataset from affecting the prediction.
AD-CORRE(FD) Analysis
Intuitively, there are two ways to address the intra-class
imbalance. Given a class, we assign trainable weight to each
subject based on frame numbers. Or, we attribute different
weights to positive and negative sequences within the same
video. Either way, however, will stimulate more dispute and
drive the problem complexity going exacerbation.
On this condition, AD-CORRE(FD)'s intention is to
ignore the frames-imbalanced issue and the positive and
negative sample problem and to only focus on the classi-
fication task at the mini-batch level. The intervention of
AD-CORRE(FD) avoids the deeper conflict. In addition,
AD-CORRE(FD) substantially decreases the computation
complexity because it only analyzes the similarity between
embeddings within the mini-batch. It accumulatively col-
lects class distribution information from previous batches to
improve its adaptive weight. Calculating within the mini-
batch is also the reason that AD-CORRE(FD) benefits from
detecting minority samples.

4. Experiments
In this section, we first introduce the I-CONECT dataset,
evaluation metrics, and implementation details. Then, we
explain our experiments, present the results, report the
ablation study, and evaluate the results.
4.1. Dataset
The Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clini-
cal Trial (I-CONECT) is to explore how social conversation
can help improve memory and may prevent dementia or
Alzheimer's disease in older adults. The study followed
research participants aged 75 and older recruited from Port-
land, Oregon, or Detroit, Michigan in the USA. The study
randomized 186 participants. The participants had a 30-
minute long chat per session with standardized interviewers
(conversational staff) 4 times a week over a period of 6
months. The control group received only weekly 10-minute
phone check-ins. All participants connected with the con-
versational staff using study-provided user-friendly devices.
Conversations were semi-structured with some standard
prompts and daily topics, but once the conversation started,
it flowed naturally for fun and engaging conversations.
Out of 186 randomized participants, 86 participants are
diagnosed as NC, while 100 people are diagnosed as MCI.
In each 30 minutes-session, participants discussed one of
the 161 selected themes, such as Summer Time, Health
Care, Military Service, Television Technology, etc. The
conversational interactions were recorded as videoes. In the
current study, we selected the following 4 themes: Crafts
Hobbies, Day Time TV Shows, Movie Genres, and School
Subjects. The interviewees talked about their crafts hobbies.
They listed their favorite daytime TV shows, discussed
preferred movie genres, and showed examples. Then, they
also recalled their campus lives in School Subjects. Table 1
shows data exploration.
We used sequence-based approaches rather than frame-
based approaches to process the dataset and extracted facial
features via a dynamic approach.
4.2. Data Processing
(a)
(b)
Figure 5:Two sample frames from the video dataset. In (a),
the window of the interviewee is bigger than that of the inter-
viewer because the interviewer was speaking. Conversely, in
(b), the interviewer was talking so that her window is bigger
than the interviewee's.
The facial features of interviewees are valuable to our
research. Usually, the subject talks like NC at the start
and the end, which prevents the model from predicting
accurately. Furthermore, Fig. 5 shows that every video has
a complex background and interviewers' faces, which has
a negative influence on predicting results. To address this
problem, we decide to drop the first 3 minutes and the last
2.5 minutes of each video. Then, EasyOCR helps detect
whether or not the upper half frame contains the subject
ID in the given frame. For frames with the subject ID on
the top, we implemented RetineFace (Deng et al., 2020)
to crop the participants' facial images and dropped all
irrelevant and interfering information. In detail, we calculate
the area of detected faces and the Intersection over Union
(IoU) of them. If IoU < 0.05, we kept the bigger face like
Fig. 5a. Otherwise, we continue to process the next frame
and drop the frame like Fig. 5b. Finally, we browse the
kept images and manually delete the wrongly saved ones.
We used this method to process different themes. The four
themes that are studied in this paper may have videos from
40 participants or less. For the sake of taking advantage of
videos thoroughly and predicting better, we select K-fold
Cross Validation and use Eq. (10) to calculate 𝐾 for each
theme.
𝐾 =⌊𝑁𝑉𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜 ∕𝐿𝐹𝑜𝑙𝑑⌋ (10)
where 𝑁𝑉𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜 and 𝐿𝐹𝑜𝑙𝑑 are the video number of the
selected theme and that of each fold. We set 𝐿𝐹𝑜𝑙𝑑 = 3in
our study. Moreover, videos in each fold belong to different
participants.
K-fold Cross Validation sets one fold as the test set
and the resting folds as the training sets every time. It
does not choose any fold as the validation set. Here, we
use the test set as the validation one during the training
process. This is to avoid overfitting the model (Ashtiani
et al., 2021). In fact, attributing some of the subjects to a
third subset inevitably shrinks the size of the training set.
Thus, the model may face monotonous facial features and
perform weakly in recognizing different samples (Ashtiani
et al., 2021). Furthermore, the model may also take valuable
representations as noise or outliers due to insufficient data
samples, which adversely affects the prediction. Hence, we
do not use a validation set in our experiments.

Simultaneously, inspired by Hou Lee & Wong (2020);
Liu et al. (2021a); Mohan & Popa (2021); Kim et al. (2022),
this study used multi frames as the input. Thus, we cut
each video into a certain number of fixed-length segments
as inputs. Let 𝐿3 be the number of consecutive frames in a
divided segment, 𝑁 represents the number of total frames.
⌊𝑁∕𝐿⌋ is the number of segments for each video.
4.3. Evaluation Metrics
Prediction accuracy, F1 score, AUC (Area Under the
Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), Sensitivity, and
Specificity are the evaluation metrics in the experiment.
McNamara and Martin stated that sensitivity and specificity
are intrinsic measures of a case definition or diagnostic test,
whereas predictive values vary with the prevalence of a
condition within a population (McNamara & Martin, 2023).
Eq. (11) presents the statistical definition of sensitivity,
which is similar to recall. Eq. (12) is the equation of
specificity.
Sensitivity = True Positive
True Positive + False Negative (11)
Specificity = True Negative
True Negative + False Positive (12)
4.4. Implementation Details
We performed data augmentation to each segment,
which contains the random horizontal and vertical flip,
random rotation, and center crop. All frames within one
set do exactly same augmentation. The batch size is 80.
Following the pattern of (Hou Lee & Wong, 2020; Liu et al.,
2021a; Mohan & Popa, 2021; Kim et al., 2022),𝐿is 16. The
initialized learning rate is 1e-6. We used Adam optimizer
and Cyclic scheduler with the mode of triangular2. The loss
function is HP loss. The epoch number is 30. We coded the
network by PyTorch 1.12.0+cu116 and ran experiments on
the NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU.
To completely evaluate the new proposed architecture,
we designed three experiments (See Sections 4.5 - 4.7).
4.5. Experiment: K-fold Validation
This experiment is to test the capability of MC-ViViT
on predicting MCI in each theme. The inputs are all the
corresponding videos.
3𝐿and 𝑇 from Section 3.1 are identical.

Specificity 75% 66.67% 71.43% 76.47%
We report the results in Table 2. MC-ViViT achieves
over 85% accuracy on all four themes. For example, MC-
ViViT predicts 29 out of 32 subjects correctly on the
theme Crafts Hobbies, which reaches the highest accuracy,
90.63%. The accuracy of School Subjects is 89.74%, which
is close to 90%. Three of the F1 Scores are more than 88%,
and only the F1 score of Day Time TV Shows is 85%. The
accuracy and F1 Score solidly support that MC-ViViT has
robust performance. The other evidence comes from AUC
Score. The average AUC of all four themes is 0.56. Given
that not all the clips have MCI features in the video, even for
subjects with MCI, it is reasonable to predict parts of their
video sequences as NC. Due to this reason, some subjects
will be correctly predicted as MCI with low scores. Thus,
the average AUC value is around 0.6.
Table 2 also shows that, on all four themes, MCI/NC has
a related balanced prediction distribution. Their Sensitivity
and Specificity are high as well. For instance, the sample of
Day Time TV Shows comprises 20 MCI subjects and 21 NC
ones. The Sensitivity over Specificity is 85%/85.71%.
4.6. Experiment: cross themes evaluation
This experiment is to test if MC-ViViT can integrate and
learn complex features from a given set of training themes
and detect MCI from different test themes correctly. We
train the video on three themes and predict the rest. This
time, we resize all the frames as96×96 to train faster. There
are no overlapped subjects between the training sets and the
test sets.
Table 3 shows all the results. MC-ViViT still provides
stable performance. It achieves over 82% accuracy and over
87% F1 Score on the three themes. The highest accuracy
is 85.71% (predict 30 out of 35 samples correctly) on the
Movie Genres, while the highest F1 Score is 89.36% on
the School Subject. The accuracy and F1 Score of this
experiment are still robust to show that MC-ViViT can
predict well. The average AUC Score of this experiment
is 0.648, which is higher than 0.56 from Section 4.5. This
value also accords with the analysis from Section 4.5. It
supports that MC-ViViT can make objective decisions. In
the meanwhile, MC-ViViT only reaches 80.49% accuracy
and 82.61% F1 Score on the Day Time TV Shows. This is
due to the smaller frame size.
Subsequently, Fig. 6a presents that, the smaller frame
size affects the Sensitivity over Specificity of MCI/NC.

Specifically, it weakens the capability of detecting negative
samples, which is NC in our experiment. Thereby, the
results of Sensitivity/Specificity are less balance than those
from Section 4.5. For example, the Sensitivity/Specificity of
movie genres increases from 90.48%/78.57% (Table 2) to
95.24%/71.43%. Smaller frame size decreasing the impor-
tant features of NC makes the NC harder to detect. There-
fore, Specificity in this experiment is lower than Section 4.5.
4.7. Ablation Study
This section discusses the effect of temporal dimension
𝑡, MC, and HP Loss on the performance of MC-ViViT
(Sections 4.7.1-4.7.3).
4.7.1. Study the most proper temporal dimension𝑡
In MC-ViViT, the frame number, 𝑇, is 16, which can
be divided by [1,2,4,8,16]. To keep Tubelet Embedding
and reduce the burden of computation, we set the temporal
dimension 𝑡as [2,4,8]alternatively to study the best value
for this research.
Table 4 and Fig. 6b show that setting 𝑡 = 4 gives
the best performance under the current configuration on
four themes. When 𝑡 = 2, the tubelet lacks adequate
temporal features for making good predictions. When𝑡=8,
the tubelet, as a long sequence or long memory, includes
many useful temporal representations for sure. But it also
requires tubelet embedding to have a larger fixed dimension
length. However, increasing this fixed length will boost
the model's total parameters, which makes the MC-ViViT
computationally expensive.
In addition, other Transformer-based models also set
𝑡 = 4while analyzing facial videos such as MTV (Yan
et al., 2022) and MSVT (Yu et al., 2023). Using 𝑡=4 helps
Transformer-based models capture local-consecutive incon-
sistency efficiently and reach sufficient performance (Yu

et al., 2023). It is also to get the best trade-off between
performance and efficiency (Yan et al., 2022). Thereby, we
choose 𝑡=4.
4.7.2. Study the effect of MC
This study is to evaluate the effect of MC structure.
In the experiment, we dropped the multi-branch structure
and changed the dimension from 16 to 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 directly.
The dimension changes will be 64 → 16 → 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠.
We collected the related experimental results in Table 5. It
shows that, for each theme, the accuracy of ViViT with MC
is at least 10% higher than that without MC. Fig. 6c bolsters
this view. Therefore, the MC module provides more features
and benefits the ViViT in predicting better.
4.7.3. Study the effect of HP Loss
This study is to test the influence of each component
of HP Loss on the prediction. We first did experiments
with Focal Loss only. Then, we did experiments with AD-
CORRE(FD) Loss only. Table 6 contains all the results and
shows that MC-ViViT using Focal loss performs better than
that using AD-CORRE(FD). In the meanwhile, the accuracy
of MC-ViViT using HP loss surpasses at least 14% than that
using either Focal loss or AD-CORRE(FD). Fig. 6d clearly
displays this huge disparity. Thereby, Table 6 and Fig. 6d
uphold that HP Loss helps the MC-ViViT perform better
than each individual component does.

5. Discussion
The experiments presented in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 and
the comparison in Table 7 indicate that MC-ViViT can
detect MCI with promising accuracy. For a selected theme,
MC-ViViT can predict subjects not included in the model
training very well. It can also infer the representations
learned from many themes to correctly predict the sub-
jects from unseen themes. The MC-ViViT's robust perfor-
mance convinces us that analyzing semi-structured inter-
view videos is useful to detect MCI.
In the meanwhile, ViViT, as the backbone, mainly pro-
vides good representations to the final prediction. These
good representations include spatial features and tempo-
ral ones. Different from manually described and learned
patterns such as head pose, eye gaze, eye-tracking, and
lip activities, Fig. 7 shows that MC-ViViT pays attention
to the different areas of the face. For example, it focuses
on regions of the forehead, eyelids, nose, cheek, and jaw.
This correlates with the statement that ViViT is capable
to monitor the motion of all facial muscles and discover
many slight changes and features. Furthermore, Sections 4.5
and 4.6 indicate that these features are very important to
decide if the subject has MCI or not. In short, ViViT takes
video clips as the input and extracts spatio-temporal features
in one stream, which enables the model to make a com-
prehensive decision. Subsequently, the ablation study from
Section 4.7 suggests that both MC and HP Loss improve
the accuracy. MC broadens the network through the multi-
branch structure, which provides different perspectives to
analyze the subject's features. MC strengthens the fea-
tures' richness, which benefits in making correct decisions.
HP Loss, then, concentrates on prediction equality. The I-
CONECT dataset is a very imbalanced dataset. Table 1
indicates that every theme has more MCI subjects than NC
ones. The focal Loss part of HP loss assigns more weight
to the class with less subjects and aims to solve the inter-
class imbalanced issues. Within each class, the different
video length causes the inequivalence of extracted frames
from each subject. The AD-CORRE(FD) part of HP Loss
changes the background of the problem from the intra-class
level to the mini-batch level. Within the mini-batch, AD-
CORRE(FD) tackles the classification task by measuring
the similarity between embedding features, which wisely
resolves the imbalance crisis and reduces the computational
complexity. Thereby, HP loss is essential to the MC-ViViT.
The experimental results from Tables 5 and 6 uphold the
above discussion. In addition, Table 2 indicates that MC-
ViViT can learn features well under one particular theme,
while Table 3 convinces us that features from other themes
can help detect MCI from NC on the left one. Subjects
perform similar features on different themes.
Figure 7: The extracted spatio-temporal feature maps on
16 consecutive frames from two subjects. MC-ViViT focuses
more on the bright areas and pays less attention on the
dark ones. Given that there are 𝑛𝑡 tubelets, where 𝑛𝑡 =
⌊𝑇
𝑡 ⌋ = ⌊16
4 ⌋ = 4, there are four feature maps. To simplify
the visualization, we pick the first frame of each tubelet to
represent it.
In general, there are two key findings. The first one is
that Transformer-based models are capable to detect MCI in
the early stage only by analyzing facial features; the second
one is that semi-structured interview videos can provide
plenty of features to help the model make quality predictions
while merely requiring the tablet computer or mobile phone
to collect. This costs much less than collecting conventional
medical images like MRI. These two findings reveal that
MC-ViViT has the potential to detect other diseases, such
as dementia and Parkinson's Disease (PD), in the early
stage. Moreover, the corresponding data collection becomes
convenient and easy to access. Even a cell phone can help
film facial videos.
On the other side, due to the lack of a consistent video
recording environment, the videos' qualities vary a lot.
From what we observed in this research, the video quality
significantly affects the prediction. We notice that MC-
ViViT usually predicts high-clarity videos rightly with high
prediction scores. Conversely, MC-ViViT is easy to give
unclear videos with low prediction scores. Or even MC-
ViViT classifies those videos with the wrong labels. This
explains the reason that Sensitivity versus Specificity is far
from equivalence. Future work will focus on establishing a
mechanism to evaluate the video quality score. The future
model will implement this score to design a new loss
function that helps tune the training process.

6. Conclusion
This paper presented MC-ViViT to detect MCI from
NC via facial videos of the semi-structured interviews (I-
CONECT dataset). The experiments show that MC-ViViT
can predict well with the help of MC and HP Loss. Simul-
taneously, it shows that the Transformer-based model can
tell whether or not people have MCI merely by analyzing
facial features from the semi-structured interview videos.
Compared to the other datasets mentioned in Section 1, the
I-CONECT dataset is easy to access, low cost, time-saving,
flexible, and less restricted. It is very valuable to spread and
propagate.
